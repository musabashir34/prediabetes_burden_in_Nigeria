  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is assuming a pandemic dimension. The number of cases of diabetes worldwide among adults 20 years and above in 2010 was estimated to be 285 million and the number will increase to 438 million by the year 2030. The major part of this numerical increase will occur in the developing countries4, Nigeria included. There is a paucity of data regarding the prevalence of DM in northern Nigeria in particular and the country in general, the latest data for the country was from the Expert committee report on Noncommunicable Disease (NCD) survey of 1997. This study is intended to contribute to data base for the national prevalence of DM. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and correlates of DM and Glucose intolerance among adults in Kano. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a multistage (3 stages) randomized cluster sampling scheme, 684 subjects were screened for diabetes mellitus according to WHO standard using casual plasma glucose. Data obtained included demography, anthropometry, blood pressure measurement and casual plasma glucose. The data was subsequently analysed using simple descriptive statistics with EPI-INFO 3.6 and Mini Tab 12 statistical packages. Correlates of DM and IGT were determined. P value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. IGT was determined through administration of 82g of glucose D to the subjects with CPG between 7.8mmol/l and 11.0mmol/l in fasting state and their 2hour post glucose load (2HPGL) estimated. Subjects with 2HPGL 7.8mmol/l but less than 11.1mmol/l were diagnosed as having IGT.~  RESULTS: A total of 700 subjects were recruited of which 684 were evaluated, giving a response rate of 97.7\%. Two hundred and fifty (36.5\%) were males and 434 (63.5\%) females. Of these 684 subjects, 59 subjects were found to have diabetes (19 males and 40 females), giving a crude total prevalence rate of 8.6\%, crude male prevalence was 7.6\% and crude female prevalence was 9.2 \%, giving male : female ratio of 1 : 1.2, when adjusted for age and sex the overall age standardized prevalence was 6.9\% (95\% CI 5.0\% - 8.8\%). The male age standardized prevalence dropped to 6.4\% (95\% CI 2.9\% - 9.4\%) while that of females dropped to 8.8\% (95\% CI 4.0\%- 13.6\%). Twenty eight subjects (4.1\%) were known to be living with diabetes before this study, while 31 (4.5\%) subjects were newly diagnosed with diabetes during this study. The predominant type of DM was type 2 DM accounting for 95.5\%. Fourty two (42) subjects were found to have IGT given a prevalence of 6.2\%, 10 (1.5\%) males and 32 (4.7\%) females. Uni-variate analysis indicated that increased body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) , waist hip ratio (WHR), physical inactivity, parental history of DM, and age were significant risk factors for DM and glucose intolerance. However, logistic regression analysis showed that age and BMI were the only independent risk factors for DM after adjusting for the other risk factors. In contrast, social class, alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking did not appear to be associated risk factors for DM or IGT in this study. Conclusions: The prevalence of DM among adults in Kano appears higher than previously reported with age and higher BMI as independent risk factors. The predominant form of DM in this study was Type 2 DM.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recently proposed the use of hemoglobin A1c as a practical and valid strategy to identify high-risk people for whom delivery of an intensive lifestyle intervention to prevent type 2 diabetes is likely to be cost effective. PURPOSE: To estimate composite risks of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) for adults with different hemoglobin A1c test results and to compare those risks with those of adults who met the 2003 ADA definition for prediabetes. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed in 2009. The method of Stern and colleagues was used to estimate the 7.5-year probability of type 2 diabetes, and the Framingham General CVD Risk Engine was used to estimate the 10-year probability of CVD for adults with different A1c results. Sample weights were used to account for sampling probability and to adjust for noncoverage and nonresponse. RESULTS: Among adults meeting the 2003 ADA definition for prediabetes, the probabilities for incident type 2 diabetes (over 7.5 years) and CVD (over 10 years) were 33.5\% and 10.7\%, respectively. Use of A1c alone, in the range of 5.5\% to {$<$}6.5\%, would identify a population with comparable risks for diabetes (32.4\% [SE=1.2\%]) and CVD (11.4\% [SE=0.6\%]). A slightly higher cutoff ({$\geq$}5.7\%) would identify adults with risks of 41.3\% (SE=1.5\%) for diabetes and 13.3\% (SE=0.8\%) for CVD-risks that are comparable to people enrolled in the Diabetes Prevention Program. CONCLUSIONS: A1c-based testing in clinical settings should be considered as a means to identify greater numbers of adults at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes and CVD.},

  abstract = {Background: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Nigeria is currently undergoing rapid epidemiological transition. The objective was to study whether urbanization is associated with increased prevalence of MetS between native rural Abuja settlers and genetically related urban dwellers. Materials and Methods: It was a cross-sectional study. Three hundred and forty-two urban native Abuja settlers and 325 rural dwellers were used for the study. Fasting blood lipid, glucose, waist circumference, blood pressure, and body mass index were determined. MetS was defined according to three standard criteria. SPSS 16.0 was used for statistical analysis. P{$<$}0.05 was used as statistically significant. Results: Obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypertension were commoner among urban dwellers than rural dwellers. MetS was associated more with the female gender. Urbanization significantly increases the frequency of MetS using the three standard definitions. The prevalence of MetS using International Diabetes Federation, World Health Organization, and National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III among rural versus urban dwellers were 7.7\% vs. 14.9\%, P{$<$}0.05; 0\% vs. 0.9\%, P{$>$}0.05; and 3.7\% vs. 13.7\%, P{$<$}0.05, respectively. Conclusion: This study shows that MetS is a major health condition among rural and urban Nigerians and that urbanization significantly increases the prevalence of MetS. This can be explained on the basis of higher prevalence of dyslipidemia, obesity, and hypertension in urban setting, possibly as a result of stress, diet, and reduction in physical activity. Effective preventive strategy is therefore required to stem the increased risk associated with urbanization to reduce the cardiovascular risk associated with MetS among Nigerians.},

  abstract = {\textbf{Background:} Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is fast becoming a global epidemic, and its prevalence is increasing in children and young adults. The aim of the study was to identify young adults who had type 2 DM or impaired fasting glucose as well as those at risk of these conditions using anthropometric data and behavioral pattern. \textbf{Methodology:} Two hundred and twenty newly admitted undergraduates who were randomly selected during the registration process were involved in the study. Anthropometric parameters were measured while information on demographic details, medical history, and family history were obtained using a standard questionnaire. Fasting blood glucose was measured using the glucose oxidase method. \textbf{Results:} Two hundred and seven (94\%) participants had serum glucose within reference range, 10 (4.6\%) had impaired fasting glucose, and 3 (1.4\%) had serum glucose {$>$}7.1 mmol/L, which is indicative of DM. A large number (91.4\%) of individuals engaged in physical activity equivalent to a walk of at least 30 min/day. Most of them (93.2\%) had body mass index {$<$}25.0 while 6.8\% were overweight. One hundred and three participants (46.8\%) indicated that they eat 3 or more servings of whole grain per day. \textbf{Conclusion:} Most of the participants are involved in healthy lifestyle. This has resulted in very low prevalence of impaired fasting glucose and type 2 DM among the group. It will be useful to follow up the group and note if they are able to maintain this trend since the risk of developing DM is known to increase with age.},

  abstract = {This survey investigated the prevalence of diabetes risk factors and diabetes mellitus among people living in Abuja. Using Simple Random and Purposive Sampling techniques for selecting geographical region and participants respectively, 417 Abuja residents were selected for the study. A standardized instrument-Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) questionnaire-was used to determine the total diabetes risk score of the participants. In additions, the participants' demographic information and biometric variables like blood pressure, blood sugar, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference were measured. The collected data were subjected to descriptive statistics of frequency count and percentage, while Chi square was used for inferential statistics to test the hypotheses at P {$\leq$} 0.05 level of significance. The result of the study revealed that majority of the participants (66.7\%) were either overweight or obese, 46.1\% had unhealthy waist circumference, 43.9\% had high blood pressure, 2.4\% had high blood sugar, 66.4\% are physically inactive, while 77.5\% do not consume vegetables or fruits every day. With respect to the risk scores of developing diabetes mellitus in the next 10 years, about half (49.9\%) of the participants are at low risk, 30.9\% are at slightly elevated risk, 11.7\% are at moderate risk, 7\% are at high risk, and only 0.5\% are at very high risk. The study concluded that the prevalence of diabetes risk factors is high among residents of Federal Capital Territory (Abuja), and a significant number of the residents are at high risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes mellitus in the next 10 years.},

This study aimed to provide up-to-date evidence on the epidemiology of insufficient physical activity across Nigeria to increase awareness and prompt relevant policy and public health response.A systematic literature search of community-based studies on physical inactivity was conducted. We constructed a meta-regression epidemiologic model to determine the age-adjusted prevalence and number of physically inactive persons in Nigeria for 1995 and 2020.Fifteen studies covering a population of 13~814 adults met our selection criteria. The pooled crude prevalence of physically inactive persons in Nigeria was 52.0\% (95\% CI: 33.7\textendash 70.4), with prevalence in women higher at 55.8\% (95\% CI: 29.4\textendash 82.3) compared to men at 49.3\% (95\% CI: 24.7\textendash 73.9). Across settings, prevalence of physically inactive persons was significantly higher among urban dwellers (56.8\%, 35.3\textendash 78.4) compared to rural dwellers (18.9\%, 11.9\textendash 49.8). Among persons aged 20\textendash 79~years, the total number of physically inactive persons increased from 14.4 million to 48.6 million between 1995 and 2020, equivalent to a 240\% increase over the 25-year period.A comprehensive and robust strategy that addresses occupational policies, town planning, awareness and information, and sociocultural and contextual issues is crucial to improving physical activity levels in Nigeria.},

Results\hspace{0.6em} 42 studies, with a total population of 91\,320, met our selection criteria. Most of the studies selected were of medium quality (90.5\%). The age-adjusted prevalence rates of T2DM in Nigeria among persons aged 20\textendash 79 years increased from 2.0\% (95\% CI 1.9\% to 2.1\%) in 1990 to 5.7\% (95\% CI 5.5\% to 5.8\%) in 2015, accounting for over 874\,000 and 4.7\,million cases, respectively. The pooled prevalence rate of impaired glucose tolerance was 10.0\% (95\% CI 4.5\% to 15.6\%), while impaired fasting glucose was 5.8\% (95\% CI 3.8\% to 7.8\%).

  abstract = {Background Targeted public health response to obesity in Nigeria is relatively low due to limited epidemiologic understanding. We aimed to estimate nationwide and sub-national prevalence of overweight and obesity in the adult Nigerian population. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, and Africa Journals Online were systematically searched for relevant epidemiologic studies in Nigeria published on or after 01 January 1990. We assessed quality of studies and conducted a random-effects meta-analysis on extracted crude prevalence rates. Using a meta-regression model, we estimated the number of overweight and obese persons in Nigeria in the year 2020. Results From 35 studies (n\,=\,52,816), the pooled crude prevalence rates of overweight and obesity in Nigeria were 25.0\% (95\% confidence interval, CI: 20.4\textendash 29.6) and 14.3\% (95\% CI: 12.0\textendash 15.5), respectively. The prevalence in women was higher compared to men at 25.5\% (95\% CI: 17.1\textendash 34.0) versus 25.2\% (95\% CI: 18.0\textendash 32.4) for overweight, and 19.8\% (95\% CI: 3.9\textendash 25.6) versus 12.9\% (95\% CI: 9.1\textendash 16.7) for obesity, respectively. The pooled mean body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference were 25.6\,kg/m2 and 86.5\,cm, respectively. We estimated that there were 21 million and 12 million overweight and obese persons in the Nigerian population aged 15\,years or more in 2020, accounting for an age-adjusted prevalence of 20.3\% and 11.6\%, respectively. The prevalence rates of overweight and obesity were consistently higher among urban dwellers (27.2\% and 14.4\%) compared to rural dwellers (16.4\% and 12.1\%). Conclusions Our findings suggest a high prevalence of overweight and obesity in Nigeria. This is marked in urban Nigeria and among women, which may in part be due to widespread sedentary lifestyles and a surge in processed food outlets, largely reflective of a trend across many African settings.KEY MESSAGESAbout 12 million persons in Nigeria were estimated to be obese in 2020, with prevalence considerably higher among women. Nutritional and epidemiological transitions driven by demographic changes, rising income, urbanization, unhealthy lifestyles, and consumption of highly processed diets appear to be driving an obesity epidemic in the country.},

  abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is a public health problem and a global health threat which scientific evidence has indicated individual's nutritional status as one of its contributing factors. Critical assessment of this contributing factor will help in reducing its prevalence. The study assessed the nutritional status and prevalence of diabetes among the elderly residing in Ilaro. It was descriptive and cross-sectional in design involving two hundred and fifty (250) elderly-people. A semi-structured and interviewer administered questionnaire was used to obtained data on socio-demographic characteristics. Anthropometric measurements \{weight (kg) and height (m)\} were taken, body mass index \{BMI (kg/m 2)\} was calculated and nutritional status indices were classified using World Health Organization (WHO) standards. Blood glucose test was carried out using Glucometer. Data were analyzed using SPSS. V.20.0. Majority of the respondents were females (59.6\%), between 60-64years(42.4\%), practice Christian religion (64.8\%) and belong to Yoruba ethnic group (94.8\%). Anthropometric measurement shows that 56.8\% of the respondents have normal BMI while 22.8\%, 10.0\% and 10.4\% were overweight, obese and underweight respectively. Random blood glucose test reveals that 8.0\% were diabetic, 3.0\% were pre-diabetic while 16.0\% and 73.0\% have low and normal blood glucose levels respectively. Significant association (p{$<$} 0.05) was observed between nutritional status and some of the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents. Also, blood glucose range was found to be significantly associated (p{$<$} 0.05) with the nutritional status of the respondents. In conclusion high prevalence of diabetes mellitus as well as overweight which co-exist with underweight was observed among the elderly sampled, thus nutrition intervention targeted at the care of the elderly is recommended.},

  abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is commonly associated with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and vice versa. Although most individuals with DM and TB pass through intermediate state of pre-diabetes mellitus (PDM) and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) respectively, however, data is scant on PDM and LTBI in co-endemic populations to inform recommendations on intervention in those settings. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of PDM and LTBI and determine the susceptibility factors among presumably low- risk adults in a high DM-and TB setting. A cross-sectional study of 352 able-bodied adults was conducted in three communities representative of the southern Nigeria population. Socio-demographic and anthropometric data of the participants were collected using a modified WHO STEPS Wise instrument. A single random blood sample was used to measure glycated hemoglobin (HbA\textsubscript{1c}) using Cobas c111 Auto-analyzer and interferon-gamma (INF-{$\gamma$}) production with the aid of Quantiferon TB-Gold-In Tube (QFT-GIT) kit. Pre-diabetes was defined as HbA\textsubscript{1c} between 5.7-6.4\% and LTBI as INF- {$\gamma$} positivity ({$\geq$}0.35 IU/ml). Overall, the prevalence of PDM was 29 (8.2\%) (95\% CI: 6.4-9.4\%) and LTBI 83 (23.6\%) (95\% CI: 21.6-27.3\%), while 9 (2.6\%) had dual PDM-LTBI. The urbanites recorded higher PDM 15 (12.8\%) (X\textsuperscript{2}=6.340, p=0.022) whereas LTBI was higher among villagers 48 (43.6\%) (X\textsuperscript{2}=36.503, p=0.0001). Risk factors associated with PDM and LTBI were: residence status, aging, smoking, familial DM and non-BCG vaccination. Aging was the single most important predictor of PDM (X\textsuperscript{2}=8.469, p=0.007), LTBI (X\textsuperscript{2}=59.541, p=0.001); with aged 50-59 years having four-fold higher risk of PDM-LTBI (OR=4.72, 95\% CI=3.25; p=0.0001). These findings indicate that one in twelve and one in four presumably healthy persons screened were found to harbor PDM and LTBI respectively. There is a twin epidemic of PDM and LTBI among southern Nigeria adults. Susceptibility pattern suggests environmental, familial and cumulative life-time risks. `Syndemic' DM and TB in the area is imminent in the absence of timeous intervention.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Urbanization and westernization now predispose rural dwellers to many of the modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). OBJECTIVES: We assessed the prevalence of CVD risk factors and electrocardiographic (ECG) pattern in 2 rural communities of Osun State, South West Nigeria. METHODS: Descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out in March 2011 in two agrarian communities as part of the activities commemorating the World Kidney Day and World Glaucoma day. A total of 259 consenting adults (age {$\geq$} 18 years) participated in the study. Pre-tested, standardized, structured questionnaire was used to collect data on socio-demographic characteristics and cardiovascular risk factors. Only 64 participants had ECG done on them. Data were analyzed using the SPSS 17 software. Approval was obtained from the institution's ethical research committee. RESULTS: Hypertension was present in 23.9\%, 7.3\% had diabetes mellitus. Left ventricular hypertrophy was present in 12.5\% and 23.4\% had prolonged QTc. Obesity was present in 11.5\%; 17.8\%, 13.5\% and 38.2\% had high total cholesterol, LDL and TG levels respectively, while 49.8\% had low HDL values. Multiple risk factors were present in 28.2\% of the total respondents. Predictors of obesity include female gender, high total cholesterol level and low HDL levels. Predictors of hypertension include age {$>$}45 years, being obese, having high total cholesterol and low HDL levels. DISCUSSION: The preponderance of multiple cardiovascular risk factors found in this study compounds the possible epidemic of CVD and its sequelae. Prolonged QTc calls for caution in administration of contraindicated drugs. CONCLUSION: CVD risk factors are present in rural areas of Nigeria hence the need for primordial and primary prevention efforts.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is reaching epidemic rates globally. It had an estimated global incidence of 220 million in 2010. Different studies in SSA and Nigeria in particular have reported increasing prevalence of diabetes in the rural areas. This may be attributed to the rapid 'westernization' of lifestyle in the rural African community.Only few rural survey have been conducted in the Nigeria oil-rich Niger Delta region necessitating this study with the aim of determining the prevalence of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose (IFG). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey involving 500 subjects aged 15 years and above in a typical rural community of Rivers State, Niger Delta region of Nigeria. A questionnaire administered by face-to-face interview was used to assess socio-demographic characteristics of the subjects. Medical history such as prior knowledge of blood sugar status and family history of diabetes were all elicited by the questionnaire. Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were taken in a standardized manner and body mass indices (BMI) calculated as weight in kilogram divided by the square of height in meters. Venous blood glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method. Diabetes mellitus was defined using fasting plasma glucose (FPG) {$\geq$} 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) and individuals who were previously known to have diabetes based on history of treatment were also classified to have diabetes. Lipid profile and uric acid of patients were also checked. RESULTS: There were 156 males and 344 females with male to female ratio of 1:2.3.The females were relatively of younger age than the males (40.62 {$\pm$} 16.6 years versus 42.84 {$\pm$} 17.8).The overall mean age was 41.32 {$\pm$} 17. The mean fasting plasma glucose among those with diabetes was 11.14?4. 00mmol/L while the mean for the subjects with impaired fasting glucose was 6.31 {$\pm$} 0.25 mmol/l. The prevalence of diabetes was 2.2\% with no significant gender difference (2.6\% in males versus 2.0\% in females; {$\chi$}2 = 0.35; p = 0.84). The prevalence of Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) was 2.4\%with no significant gender difference (Female 2.6\% versus males 1.9\%; p = 0.88). The mean fasting glucose increased significantly with blood pressure (p = 0.05), waist circumference (p {$<$} 0.001), uric acid level (0.02), triglyceride level ({$<$} 0.001) and age (p = 0.02).The correlation analyses showed that age, systolic blood pressure, waist-hip-ratio and triglycerides are positively correlated with diabetes and impaired fasting glucose in this study. CONCLUSION: There is a low prevalence of diabetes and IFG in this rural community which may be associated to the high level of physical activity found among the study subjects in this community. However, this study confirmed that increasing age, abdominal obesity, systolic blood pressure and triglyceride level have positive relationship with the prevalence of diabetes and IFG. There is hence more need for intensified screening for diabetes, pre-diabetes and associated risk factors in order to curb or at least reduce diabetes prevalence and its attendant complications.},

  abstract = {The current classification and diagnosis of diabetes used in the U.S. was developed by the National Diabetes Data Group (NDDG) and published in 1979 (1). The impetus for the classification and diagnosis scheme proposed then holds true today. That is, the growth of knowledge regarding the etiology and pathogenesis of diabetes has led many individuals and groups in the diabetes community to express the need for a revision of the nomenclature, diagnostic criteria, and classification of diabetes. As a consequence, it was deemed essential to develop an appropriate, uniform terminology and a functional, working classification of diabetes that reflects the current knowledge about the disease. (1) It is now considered to be particularly important to move away from a system that appears to base the classification of the disease, in large part, on the type of pharmacological treatment used in its management toward a system based on disease etiology where possible. An international Expert Committee, working under the sponsorship of the American Diabetes Association, was established in May 1995 to review the scientific literature since 1979 and to decide if changes to the classification and diagnosis of diabetes were warranted. The Committee met on multiple occasions and widely circulated a draft report of their findings and preliminary recommendations to the international diabetes community. Based on the numerous comments and suggestions received, including the opportunity to review unpublished data in detail, the Committee discussed and revised numerous drafts of a manuscript that culminated in this published document. This report is divided into four sections: definition and description of diabetes, classification of the disease, diagnostic criteria, and testing for diabetes. The aim of this document is to define and describe diabetes as we know it today, present a classification scheme that reflects its etiology and/or pathogenesis, provide guidelines for the diagnosis \ldots},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Body fat distribution has been reported as a significant risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and other forms of Glucose Intolerance. Anthropometric Indices including BMI, WC, and WHR are used as surrogate measures of body fat distribution. Definitive values of BMI, WC, and WHR are used to characterize individuals into general or central obesity. Few studies have evaluated the relationship between anthropometric indices and Glucose Intolerance in Nigerian population. This study was carried out to compare the discriminatory ability of these indices in correctly identifying individuals with glucose intolerance among Urban adults in Jos.  OBJECTIVES To evaluate the anthropometric Indices of BMI, WC, WHR as correlates of Glucose Intolerance and to determine the prevalence of IFG, IGT, and DM, in the study population and also the prevalence of obesity in the population.  SUBJECTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS A three-stage random sampling was used to enroll 800 subjects {$\geq$}20 years of age residing in Jos. Ill and pregnant subjects were excluded. Out of the 800 subjects, 709 responded and participated in the study giving a response rate of 88.6\%. Demographic and clinical data were obtained using a modified WHO STEPS Questionnaire. Anthropometric indices including weight, height, waist circumference and hip circumference were measured. BMI and WHR were calculated. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was estimated after 8-12 hours overnight fast. Oral Glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with 75g glucose was also carried out for all subjects. Fasting plasma Insulin was assayed in a subset of 119 subjects to determine Insulin Resistance using Homeostasis model assessment ( HOMA-IR). Data was~ analyzed with Epi info 3.6.1.and SPSS 16.0. Receiver-Operator characteristic curve was used to test the prediction of glucose intolerance by the anthropometric indices. All p-values less than 0.05 was considered significant.  RESULTS The subjects were made up of 43.4\% of males and 56.6\% of females. The mean (SD) age of subjects was 43.21 (14.74) years with a range of 20-89. There was no significant difference in mean age of male and females. Mean (SD) WC and BMI were higher in females than males [WC: 87.5(12.5)cm vs 85.2(10.8)cm, p=0.009, BMI: 27.4 (5.1)kg/m2 vs 25.3(3.7)kg/m2, p=0.001] while WHR was higher in males than females [0.88(0.07) vs 0.86(0.07), p=0.02]. The differences were statistically significant. The overall prevalence of IFG was 2.7\% (3.2\% in men, 2.2\% in women, p=0.41) while that of IGT was 7.5\% (5.5\% in men, 8.5\% in women, p=0.13). The prevalence of DM in the study population was 4.1\% (4.5\% men, 3.7\% in women, p=0.59). The prevalence of IFG and DM were higher in men while that of IGT was higher in women, however none was significant. The prevalence of Overweight and Obesity using BMI was 35\% and 21\% (10.7\% in men, 28.9\% in women, p=0.0001) respectively. The prevalence of Central Obesity using WHR was 52.6\% (39.3\% in men, 63.1\% in women, p=0.0001) while it was 30.7\% (8.8\% in men, 47.6\% in women, p=0.0001) using WC (NCEP 111) and 47.8\% (21.8\% in men, 67.8\% in women, p=0.0001) using WC (IDF). Obesity was significantly commoner in women than men. Receiver \textendash{} Operator Characteristic Curve showed that all the studied indices had significantly higher AUC than the Null hypothesis true area of 0.5, but WHR had the highest Area under the Curve (AUC) for IFG, IGT and DM in both men and women. It performed better than WC and BMI in that order.~ CONCLUSION The results from this study showed that the prevalence of IGT was higher than that of IFG (7.5\% vs 2.7\%). There was also higher prevalence of IGT than DM (7.5\% vs 4.1\%) with implications for the future prevalence of DM. Prevalence of Central Obesity using WHR was higher than using WC and also higher than generalized obesity with BMI (52.6\% vs 30.7\% vs 21\%). Out of the three tested anthropometric indices (BMI, WC, WHR), WHR had the best ability to identify Individuals with Glucose Intolerance (GI) in the studied population. WHR, a measure of central obesity is better correlated to Glucose Intolerance than other anthropometric indices.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with complications and orodental disease. Whether screening for DM during orodental health visits is a potential option is yet to be established in Nigeria. This study aims at assessing the prevalence of hyperglycemia in orodental disease as a clinical scenario to capitalize for opportunistic screening. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was undertaken in Catholic Hospital Abbi for Ndokwa communities and dental clinic of Eku Baptist Government Hospital, all in Nigeria. However, 474 individuals (433 community-based and 41 dental clinic-based) including 10 orodental cases were screened for hyperglycemia and waist-hip circumference indices. Blood lipid profiles were also performed. Based on fasting blood glucose levels, participants were grouped into non-diabetic (n = 172), prediabetic (n = 168), and diabetic (n = 78). A World Health Organization questionnaire on oral health was used to collect information on orodental disease risk factors. Data were analyzed with IBM SPSS 22 statistical package. RESULTS: In the community-based cohort, the prevalence of hyperglycemia was 56.8\%, including 38.8\% prediabetes and 18.0\% undiagnosed DM (UDM). In the dental-based group, 63.4\% were hyperglycemic including 53.7\% prediabetes and 9.7\% UDM. There was significant difference (P {$<$} 0.05) in the ages of the participants in relation to glycemic status, with 17-29 years having the highest prevalence of UDM. However, 42.5\% of the community-based clients had indication(s) of orodental disease. CONCLUSION: This is probably the first study to highlight higher prevalence of hyperglycemia from screening at a dental setting compared to general clinic. Opportunistic screening of DM in dental settings may be an option to consider during clients' orodental health visits.},

METHODS: Population-based cross-sectional studies published between January 1, 2000 and April 30, 2017 including apparently healthy adults residing in Cameroon were searched in PubMed, EMBASE, African Journals Online, and African Index Medicus. We used a random-effects model to pool data. RESULTS: All included studies had a low risk of bias. Six studies were conducted in an urban setting only, one in a rural setting only, and five in both settings. The overall prevalence of diabetes mellitus was 5.8\% (95\%CI 4.1-7.9; 12 studies) in a pooled sample of 37,147 participants. The prevalence of prediabetes was 7.1\% (95\%CI: 3.0-21.9; 4 studies) in a pooled sample of 5,872 people. In univariable meta-regression analysis, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus increased with age, hypertension, overweight and obesity. There was no difference for sex and settings (rural versus urban). CONCLUSIONS: This study reports a relatively high prevalence of diabetes mellitus and prediabetes in Cameroon, with no difference between urban and rural settings and between sexes. The main drivers include increasing age, overweight and obesity. Community-based educational programs are needed to tackle the burden of the disease in the country.},

Evidence is increasingly demonstrating that prediabetes is a toxic state, in addition to being a harbinger of future development of diabetes mellitus. This minireview discusses the pathophysiology and clinical significance of prediabetes, and approach to its management, in the context of the worldwide diabetes epidemic. The pathophysiologic defects underlying prediabetes include insulin resistance, {$\beta$} cell dysfunction, increased lipolysis, inflammation, suboptimal incretin effect, and possibly hepatic glucose overproduction. Recent studies have revealed that the long-term complications of diabetes may manifest in some people with prediabetes; these complications include classical microvascular and macrovascular disorders, and our discussion explores the role of glycemia in their development. Finally, landmark intervention studies in prediabetes, including lifestyle modification and pharmacologic treatment, are reviewed.},

Data sources               Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar) up to 25 April 2020.                                         Review methods               Prospective cohort studies or post hoc analysis of clinical trials were included for analysis if they reported adjusted relative risks, odds ratios, or hazard ratios of all cause mortality or cardiovascular disease for prediabetes compared with normoglycaemia. Data were extracted independently by two investigators. Random effects models were used to calculate the relative risks and 95\% confidence intervals. The primary outcomes were all cause mortality and composite cardiovascular disease. The secondary outcomes were the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.                                         Results               A total of 129 studies were included, involving 10\,069\,955 individuals for analysis. In the general population, prediabetes was associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality (relative risk 1.13, 95\% confidence interval 1.10 to 1.17), composite cardiovascular disease (1.15, 1.11 to 1.18), coronary heart disease (1.16, 1.11 to 1.21), and stroke (1.14, 1.08 to 1.20) in a median follow-up time of 9.8 years. Compared with normoglycaemia, the absolute risk difference in prediabetes for all cause mortality, composite cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and stroke was 7.36 (95\% confidence interval 9.59 to 12.51), 8.75 (6.41 to 10.49), 6.59 (4.53 to 8.65), and 3.68 (2.10 to 5.26) per 10\,000 person years, respectively. Impaired glucose tolerance carried a higher risk of all cause mortality, coronary heart disease, and stroke than impaired fasting glucose. In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, prediabetes was associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality (relative risk 1.36, 95\% confidence interval 1.21 to 1.54), composite cardiovascular disease (1.37, 1.23 to 1.53), and coronary heart disease (1.15, 1.02 to 1.29) in a median follow-up time of 3.2 years, but no difference was seen for the risk of stroke (1.05, 0.81 to 1.36). Compared with normoglycaemia, in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the absolute risk difference in prediabetes for all cause mortality, composite cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and stroke was 66.19 (95\% confidence interval 38.60 to 99.25), 189.77 (117.97 to 271.84), 40.62 (5.42 to 78.53), and 8.54 (32.43 to 61.45) per 10 000 person years, respectively. No significant heterogeneity was found for the risk of all outcomes seen for the different definitions of prediabetes in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (all P{$>$}0.10).                                         Conclusions               Results indicated that prediabetes was associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease in the general population and in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Screening and appropriate management of prediabetes might contribute to primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar and OpenGrey) for studies up to 31 December 2020. Studies were included for meta-analysis if they reported adjusted relative risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of HF for prediabetes compared with normoglycaemia. Prediabetes was defined as impaired fasting glucose (IFG) according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (IFG-WHO), or according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) definition (IFG-ADA), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), raised HbA1c according to the ADA criteria (HbA1c-ADA), or according to the International Expert Committee (IEC) recommendation (HbA1c-IEC). RESULTS: A total of 15 studies comprising 9,827,430 individuals provided data for this analysis. The median follow-up duration of the included studies was 8.0\,years. Compared with normoglycaemia, prediabetes was associated with an increased risk for HF: IFG-ADA (RR: 1.09, 95\% CI: 1.05-1.13), IFG-WHO (RR: 1.18, 95\% CI: 1.07-1.30), IGT (RR 1.58, 95\% CI 1.04-2.39), HbA1c-ADA (RR 1.28, 95\% CI 1.16-1.41) or HbA1c-IEC (RR 1.40, 95\% CI 1.09-1.79), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Prediabetes is associated with an increased risk of HF. Future studies are needed to evaluate effective treatments for prediabetes to prevent the development and progression of HF.},

Most meta-analytic models assume independence among effect sizes. However, effect sizes can be dependent for various reasons. For example, studies might report multiple effect sizes on the same construct, and effect sizes reported by participants from the same cultural group are likely to be more similar than those reported by other cultural groups. This article reviews the problems and common methods to handle dependent effect sizes. The objective of this article is to demonstrate how 3-level meta-analyses can be used to model dependent effect sizes. The advantages of the structural equation modeling approach over the multilevel approach with regard to conducting a 3-level meta-analysis are discussed. This article also seeks to extend the key concepts of Q statistics, I2, and R2 from 2-level meta-analyses to 3-level meta-analyses. The proposed procedures are implemented using the open source metaSEM package for the R statistical environment. Two real data sets are used to illustrate these procedures. New research directions related to 3-level meta-analyses are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).},

  abstract = {\textbf{Background:} The burden of diabetes mellitus in Nigeria has been estimated to be on the increase over the past few decades. Its prevalence has also been noted to vary across rural, semi-urban, and urban areas in the country and also across age groups. This study was conducted as part of a non-communicable disease survey in north-central Nigeria carried out in 2008. \textbf{Aim:} To determine the prevalence of type II diabetes mellitus among elderly individuals in Gindiri\textemdash a rural area in Mangu local government area of Plateau State, north-central Nigeria. \textbf{Methodology:} Consecutive subjects were recruited from the study population. A total of 197 subjects were found to be 60 years of age or older and these were screened for the presence of diabetes mellitus. Those found to have diabetes mellitus were referred to the Jos University Teaching Hospital Primary healthcare Centre in Gindiri for follow-up. \textbf{Results:} There were 124 female and 73 male elderly subjects, respectively. Both genders had similar age (\emph{P} {$>$} 0.10), BMI (\emph{P} {$>$} 0.10), and waist/hip ratio. The mean random blood glucose was also similar. Out of the eight subjects who were found to have diabetes, two were old patients already on treatment whereas six were new cases diagnosed on account of a random blood glucose of over 11.1\,mmol/L. The prevalence of type II diabetes mellitus among elderly rural dwellers in Gindiri is 4.06\%. \textbf{Conclusion:} The prevalence of diabetes mellitus among the elderly in rural Africa is higher than in the general population. The vast majority are asymptomatic and have fewer associated comorbidities which thus leads to delayed hospital presentation. The rate is however much lower than the corresponding prevalence rates among the elderly in more highly urbanized areas of the world. This may be due to differences in diet and lifestyle. It is noted however that the prevalence of diabetes mellitus is increasing in the rural area.},

Out of a total of 492 eligible respondents for the study, a subsample of 199 persons was recruited using a systematic sampling technique had their fasting blood glucose levels determined. Body mass indices of the participants were also determined. RESULTS: A total of 199 subjects (94 males and 105 females) participated in this segment of the study Three subjects had fasting blood glucose (FBG) of more than 7.0 mmol/L; one participant a previously known diabetic on medication had a good glycaemic control. The overall prevalence of diabetes was 2.0\%.Five participants (2.5\%) had impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Among the diabetics, one was overweight (BMI = 27.43 Kg/m2) and one was obese (BMI = 31.55 Kg/m2), while among those with impaired fasting glucose two were overweight. Forty-three subjects (21.6\%) were overweight and 15 (7.5\%) were obese. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in this semi-urban community is keeping with what had been reported earlier from across the country.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were later contradicted by large trials. We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses. DESIGN: Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30\% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision. RESULTS: In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. In 14 (38\%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13\%) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias. CONCLUSIONS: A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution.},

This study therefore investigated the prevalence of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose in a convenient population of adults in Umudike, a semi-urban town in SouthEast Nigeria. The relationship between measures of obesity and blood glucose concentration was also evaluated. Standard protocols were followed for all measurements, determinations and definitions. The results show that the prevalence of diabetes in the studied population is 3.0\% (3.6\% for females and 2.3\% for males). Impaired fasting glucose was found in 1.1\% of the population (females 1.6\%; males 0.6\%), such that 4.1\% of the population had dysglycemia. Diabetic females had significantly (P {$<$} 0.02) higher body mass index (BMI), fat mass, waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHpR) compared to non-diabetic female subjects. For the males, mean BMI and fat mass were statistically similar between the groups whereas WHtR and WHpR were significantly (P {$<$} 0.01) higher in diabetics. The assessed measures of obesity (except for BMI in males) were weakly but significantly (r {$<$} 0.5, P {$<$} 0.05) correlated with blood glucose concentration in all subjects.

The modal age range for those who were diabetic or overweight/obese was 26-40 years irrespective of sex. Blood glucose concentration was found to be significantly correlated only with BMI (r = +0.116; P {$<$} 0.01). The preponderance of both diabetes/IFG and overweight/obesity in women as seen in this study is indeed a double jeopardy, requiring urgent interventions.},

  abstract = {Obesity and diabetes are major public health problems in developing countries in the 21st century. The fundamental cause is imbalance between energy intake on one hand and energy expenditure on the other hand which is attributable to westernized lifestyle and decreased physical activity. This study was designed to assess the relationship between body mass index and fasting blood glucose of adult Nigerians in Makurdi metropolis, North Central Nigeria. . A total of five thousand one hundred and twenty participants (3326 males (65\%) and 1794 females (35\%) were randomly recruited for this study. The following measurements were taken -weight, height, and fasting blood sugar. Results showed mean values to be as follows, weight (68.8{$\pm$}0.2 kg), height (1.61{$\pm$}0.002 m2), BMI (26.42{$\pm$}0.08kg/m2) and FBG (6.7{$\pm$}0.03) for male participants compared to female with weight 70.1{$\pm$}0.3kg) height (1.62{$\pm$}0.002m2), BMI(26.9{$\pm$}0.1kg/m2),FBG(6.7{$\pm$}0.4mmol/L)Fasting blood sugar showed no significant differences (P{$<$}0.05)..Female showed higher body mass index in respect to male participants. Females were predisposed to higher risk factors of overweight and obesity compared to the males participants. Female have higher overweight and obesity tendency than male of the same age distribution .In conclusion, there is therefore a need to organize nutritional and physical, educational program to enhance a healthy living among adult Nigerians in Makurdi .North Central Nigeria.},

This multiplicity of anthropometric indices has led to inconsistency in their correlation with fasting blood glucose (FBG) and blood pressure. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of obesity using different anthropometric indices and their correlation with FBG and blood pressure among university students in Kano, Nigeria. Materials and Methods: One hundred and forty-eight participants were randomly selected for the study. Anthropometric indices, FBG, and blood pressure were measured following standard protocols. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 23.0. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to determine relationship between quantitative variables. P value {$\leq$} 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Mean age of the participants was 22.09 years {$\pm$} 4.03. Prevalence of obesity was: BMI - 4.8\%; WC \textendash{} 23.1\%; WHR \textendash{} 31.76\%; WHtR \textendash{} 31.76\%. BMI was positively correlated with DBP and MAP. WC was positively correlated with SBP, DBP, and MAP. WHtR was positively correlated with SBP, DBP, and MAP among female participants only. WHR was negatively correlated with DBP and MAP in male participants only. WC, WHtR, and WHR were positively correlated with FBG among female participants only. Conclusion: Prevalence of obesity among undergraduate students in Kano is high. There was wide variation in the correlation between anthropometric indices and FBG and blood pressure.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 3,819 individuals aged {$>$} or = 25 years with IGT who were found to be eligible to participant in the Diabetes Prevention Program. A1C was compared among five racial and ethnic groups before and after adjustment for factors that differed among groups or might affect glycemia including age, sex, education, marital status, blood pressure, adiposity (BMI and waist circumference), hematocrit, fasting and post-glucose load glucose levels, glucose area under the curve (AUC), beta-cell function, and insulin resistance. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD A1C was 5.91 +/- 0.50\%. Among whites, A1C was 5.80 +/- 0.44\%, among Hispanics 5.89 +/- 0.46\%, among Asian 5.96 +/- 0.45\%, among American Indians 5.96 +/- 0.46\%, and among blacks 6.19 +/- 0.59\%. Age, sex, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, BMI, fasting glucose, glucose AUC, corrected insulin response, and insulin resistance were each independent predictors of A1C. Adjusting for these and other factors, mean A1C levels were 5.78\% for whites, 5.93\% for Hispanics, 6.00\% for Asians, 6.12\% for American Indians, and 6.18\% for blacks (P {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A1C levels are higher among U.S. racial and ethnic minority groups with IGT after adjustment for factors likely to affect glycemia. Among patients with IGT, A1C may not be valid for assessing and comparing glycemic control across racial and ethnic groups or as an indicator of health care disparities.},

DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS: The trial enrolled 2094 patients with type 2 diabetes, ages 30-80 yr, from 11 countries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Estimated mean plasma glucose (MPG), A1c, and 1,5-AG were compared among racial/ethnic groups before and after adjusting for factors affecting glycemia: age, sex, duration of diabetes, body mass index, and MPG. RESULTS: Baseline estimated MPG +/- sd was 220.0 +/- 82.0 mg/dl, mean A1c was 9.0 +/- 1.3\%, and 1,5-AG was 5.0 +/- 4.1microg/ml.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Improved blood-glucose control decreases the progression of diabetic microvascular disease, but the effect on macrovascular complications is unknown. There is concern that sulphonylureas may increase cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and that high insulin concentrations may enhance atheroma formation. We compared the effects of intensive blood-glucose control with either sulphonylurea or insulin and conventional treatment on the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes in a randomised controlled trial. METHODS: 3867 newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes, median age 54 years (IQR 48-60 years), who after 3 months' diet treatment had a mean of two fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations of 6.1-15.0 mmol/L were randomly assigned intensive policy with a sulphonylurea (chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or glipizide) or with insulin, or conventional policy with diet. The aim in the intensive group was FPG less than 6 mmol/L. In the conventional group, the aim was the best achievable FPG with diet alone; drugs were added only if there were hyperglycaemic symptoms or FPG greater than 15 mmol/L. Three aggregate endpoints were used to assess differences between conventional and intensive treatment: any diabetes-related endpoint (sudden death, death from hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia, fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, stroke, renal failure, amputation [of at least one digit], vitreous haemorrhage, retinopathy requiring photocoagulation, blindness in one eye, or cataract extraction); diabetes-related death (death from myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, renal disease, hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia, and sudden death); all-cause mortality. Single clinical endpoints and surrogate subclinical endpoints were also assessed. All analyses were by intention to treat and frequency of hypoglycaemia was also analysed by actual therapy. FINDINGS: Over 10 years, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 7.0\% (6.2-8.2) in the intensive group compared with 7.9\% (6.9-8.8) in the conventional group--an 11\% reduction. There was no difference in HbA1c among agents in the intensive group. Compared with the conventional group, the risk in the intensive group was 12\% lower (95\% CI 1-21, p=0.029) for any diabetes-related endpoint; 10\% lower (-11 to 27, p=0.34) for any diabetes-related death; and 6\% lower (-10 to 20, p=0.44) for all-cause mortality. Most of the risk reduction in the any diabetes-related aggregate endpoint was due to a 25\% risk reduction (7-40, p=0.0099) in microvascular endpoints, including the need for retinal photocoagulation. There was no difference for any of the three aggregate endpoints between the three intensive agents (chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin). Patients in the intensive group had more hypoglycaemic episodes than those in the conventional group on both types of analysis (both p{$<$}0.0001). The rates of major hypoglycaemic episodes per year were 0.7\% with conventional treatment, 1.0\% with chlorpropamide, 1.4\% with glibenclamide, and 1.8\% with insulin. Weight gain was significantly higher in the intensive group (mean 2.9 kg) than in the conventional group (p{$<$}0.001), and patients assigned insulin had a greater gain in weight (4.0 kg) than those assigned chlorpropamide (2.6 kg) or glibenclamide (1.7 kg). INTERPRETATION: Intensive blood-glucose control by either sulphonylureas or insulin substantially decreases the risk of microvascular complications, but not macrovascular disease, in patients with type 2 diabetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Background: Prediabetes defines a metabolic condition that heralds the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Considering the higher prevalence of prediabetes than DM worldwide, and the increased burden of T2DM in Sub-Saharan Africa, much attention is given to the identification of at risk individuals for early intervention. Aim: To evaluate the prevalence of prediabetes and its associated risk factors among staff and students of Federal University Dutse (FUD). Methods: The cross-sectional study recruited 100 staff and students of FUD aged between 20-79 years. A semi structured questionnaire was used to obtain socio-demographic data while anthropometric data and blood glucose levels were measured using standard procedures. The World Health Organisation (WHO) criterion of impaired fasting blood glucose (IFG) of 6.1-6.9 mmol/L was used to define prediabetes. Results: The mean age of the studied population was 23.74{$\pm$}5.88 years with 96\% and 72\% having normal body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure respectively. Sixteen (16) prediabetic individuals comprising of 7 females and 9 males with a mean fasting blood glucose (FBS) of 7.0 {$\pm$} 1.4 mmol/L had a BMI and waist circumference (WC) ranging from 14.8 to 21.8 kg/m2 and 59.6 to 96.8 cm respectively. BMI (r=0.73; p{$<$}0.05) abdominal obesity (measured by waist circumference (r=0.75; p{$<$}0.05), and blood pressure (r=0.81; p{$<$}0.05) were found to be positively associated with increased risk of prediabetes development. Additionally, increased physical activity and employment status were both associated with increased prediabetes risk but not with higher age, marital status, ethnicity and smoking. Conclusion: Prevalence of prediabetes (16\%) in FUD was found to be associated with decreased physical activity, being overweight, obese, employed and hypertensive. Routine sessional screening for staff and students as well as health education on lifestyle modification strategies for at risk individuals is highly recommended.

SETTING: 31 provinces in mainland China with nationally representative cross sectional data from 2015 to 2017. PARTICIPANTS: 75\,880 participants aged 18 and older-a nationally representative sample of the mainland Chinese population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of diabetes among adults living in China, and the prevalence by sex, regions, and ethnic groups, estimated by the 2018 American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the World Health Organization diagnostic criteria. Demographic characteristics, lifestyle, and history of disease were recorded by participants on a questionnaire. Anthropometric and clinical assessments were made of serum concentrations of fasting plasma glucose (one measurement), two hour plasma glucose, and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of total diabetes (n=9772), self-reported diabetes (n=4464), newly diagnosed diabetes (n=5308), and prediabetes (n=27\,230) diagnosed by the ADA criteria were 12.8\% (95\% confidence interval 12.0\% to 13.6\%), 6.0\% (5.4\% to 6.7\%), 6.8\% (6.1\% to 7.4\%), and 35.2\% (33.5\% to 37.0\%), respectively, among adults living in China. The weighted prevalence of total diabetes was higher among adults aged 50 and older and among men. The prevalence of total diabetes in 31 provinces ranged from 6.2\% in Guizhou to 19.9\% in Inner Mongolia. Han ethnicity had the highest prevalence of diabetes (12.8\%) and Hui ethnicity had the lowest (6.3\%) among five investigated ethnicities. The weighted prevalence of total diabetes (n=8385) using the WHO criteria was 11.2\% (95\% confidence interval 10.5\% to 11.9\%). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of diabetes has increased slightly from 2007 to 2017 among adults living in China. The findings indicate that diabetes is an important public health problem in China.},

However, data on the prognostic impact of prediabetes in HF are inconclusive. This meta-analysis aimed to explore the association between prediabetes and the risk of all-cause mortality and adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with HF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched multiple electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Google Scholar) for relevant studies up to 31 March 2021. Studies were included for analysis if multivariable adjusted relative risks of adverse outcomes were reported in patients with prediabetes and with HF compared with those with normoglycaemia. Random-effects models were used to calculate the pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Twelve studies comprising 28\,643 patients with HF reported the risk of all-cause mortality and cardiac outcomes associated with prediabetes. The prevalence of prediabetes ranged from 9.6\% to 37.2\%. After a median follow-up duration of 2.3\,years, patients with HF and with prediabetes were associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.29, 95\% CI 1.06-1.58), cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.59, 95\% CI 1.09-2.32), HF hospitalization (HR 1.33, 95\% CI 1.09-1.61), all-cause mortality and/or HF hospitalization (HR 1.22, 95\% CI 1.01-1.47), as well as cardiovascular mortality and/or HF hospitalization (HR 1.21, 95\% CI 1.07-1.37). CONCLUSIONS: Prediabetes is associated with a worse prognosis in patients with HF. Further risk stratification and effective treatment strategies are needed in patients with prediabetes and with HF to improve the prognosis.},

The purpose of this paper was to report trends in prevalence of prediabetes for individuals aged 16 and older in England without previously diagnosed diabetes. SETTING: Data collected by the Health Survey for England (HSE) in England in the years 2003, 2006, 2009 and 2011. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 16 and older who participated in the HSE and provided a blood sample. PRIMARY OUTCOME VARIABLE: Individuals were classified as having prediabetes if glycated haemoglobin was between 5.7\% and 6.4\% and were not previously diagnosed with diabetes. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of prediabetes increased from 11.6\% to 35.3\% from 2003 to 2011. By 2011, 50.6\% of the population who were overweight (body mass index (BMI){$>$}25) and {$\geq$}40\hspace{0.25em}years of age had prediabetes. In bivariate relationships, individuals with greater socioeconomic deprivation were more likely to have prediabetes in 2003 (p=0.0008) and 2006 (p=0.0246), but the relationship was not significant in 2009 (p=0.213) and 2011 (p=0.3153). In logistic regressions controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, BMI and high blood pressure, the second most socioeconomically deprived had a significantly elevated risk of having prediabetes (2011, OR=1.45; 95\% CI 1.26 to 1.88). CONCLUSIONS: There has been a marked increase in the proportion of adults in England with prediabetes. The socioeconomically deprived are at substantial risk. In the absence of concerted and effective efforts to reduce risk, the number of people with diabetes is likely to increase steeply in coming years.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Prediabetes is a condition in which individuals have blood glucose levels higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes mellitus. Inadequate moderate-intensity physical activity, amidst other risk factors, is a well-documented risk factor for prediabetes. Hospital administrative staff can be particularly vulnerable to prediabetes because of the greater number of hours spent in a sitting or sedentary position during administrative duties. The aim of this study was to find the prevalence of prediabetes and to determine its predictors among administrative staff of a tertiary health centre in southwestern Nigeria. Method: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study carried out among 300 administrative staff of the University College Hospital, Ibadan over a period of three months. Data was collected using a semi-structured questionnaire that was adapted from the generic WHO-STEPs instrument approach to surveillance of chronic non-communicable diseases risk factors. Data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17. Descriptive analyses were performed to estimate the prevalence of prediabetes while the independent predictors of prediabetes were investigated using multinomial logistic regression model. The level of statistical significance was set at p {$<$} 0.05. Results: The mean age of participants was 51.2 {$\pm$} 5.3 years. There were 164 (54.7\%) males and 136 (45.3\%) females that participated in the study. The prevalence of prediabetes was 22.3\%. Based on the final multivariable multinomial model, the independent predictors of prediabetes included; male sex (OR= 1.24; 95\% CI= 1.082 - 2.460), positive family history of diabetes mellitus (OR= 1.57; 95\% CI= 1.088 - 2.611), alcohol intake (OR= 1.13; 95\% CI= 0.688 - 1.543) and inadequate moderate-intensity physical activity (OR= 1.49; 95\% CI= 1.027 - 2.936). Conclusion: There was a high prevalence of prediabetes among the administrative staff of University College Hospital, Ibadan. Regular screening of hospital employees for prediabetes is highly recommended. Work-place exercise should be advocated to improve moderate-intensity physical activity among hospital employees.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Previous studies have shown increasing prevalence of diabetes in the United States. New US data are available to estimate prevalence of and trends in diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the recent prevalence and update US trends in total diabetes, diagnosed diabetes, and undiagnosed diabetes using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional surveys conducted between 1988-1994 and 1999-2012 of nationally representative samples of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population; 2781 adults from 2011-2012 were used to estimate recent prevalence and an additional 23,634 adults from 1988-2010 were used to estimate trends. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The prevalence of diabetes was defined using a previous diagnosis of diabetes or, if diabetes was not previously diagnosed, by (1) a hemoglobin A1c level of 6.5\% or greater or a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of 126 mg/dL or greater (hemoglobin A1c or FPG definition) or (2) additionally including 2-hour plasma glucose (2-hour PG) level of 200 mg/dL or greater (hemoglobin A1c, FPG, or 2-hour PG definition). Prediabetes was defined as a hemoglobin A1c level of 5.7\% to 6.4\%, an FPG level of 100 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL, or a 2-hour PG level of 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL. RESULTS: In the overall 2011-2012 population, the unadjusted prevalence (using the hemoglobin A1c, FPG, or 2-hour PG definitions for diabetes and prediabetes) was 14.3\% (95\% CI, 12.2\%-16.8\%) for total diabetes, 9.1\% (95\% CI, 7.8\%-10.6\%) for diagnosed diabetes, 5.2\% (95\% CI, 4.0\%-6.9\%) for undiagnosed diabetes, and 38.0\% (95\% CI, 34.7\%-41.3\%) for prediabetes; among those with diabetes, 36.4\% (95\% CI, 30.5\%-42.7\%) were undiagnosed. The unadjusted prevalence of total diabetes (using the hemoglobin A1c or FPG definition) was 12.3\% (95\% CI, 10.8\%-14.1\%); among those with diabetes, 25.2\% (95\% CI, 21.1\%-29.8\%) were undiagnosed. Compared with non-Hispanic white participants (11.3\% [95\% CI, 9.0\%-14.1\%]), the age-standardized prevalence of total diabetes (using the hemoglobin A1c, FPG, or 2-hour PG definition) was higher among non-Hispanic black participants (21.8\% [95\% CI, 17.7\%-26.7\%]; P\,{$<$}\,.001), non-Hispanic Asian participants (20.6\% [95\% CI, 15.0\%-27.6\%]; P\,=\,.007), and Hispanic participants (22.6\% [95\% CI, 18.4\%-27.5\%]; P\,{$<$}\,.001). The age-standardized percentage of cases that were undiagnosed was higher among non-Hispanic Asian participants (50.9\% [95\% CI, 38.3\%-63.4\%]; P\,=\,.004) and Hispanic participants (49.0\% [95\% CI, 40.8\%-57.2\%]; P\,=\,.02) than all other racial/ethnic groups. The age-standardized prevalence of total diabetes (using the hemoglobin A1c or FPG definition) increased from 9.8\% (95\% CI, 8.9\%-10.6\%) in 1988-1994 to 10.8\% (95\% CI, 9.5\%-12.0\%) in 2001-2002 to 12.4\% (95\% CI, 10.8\%-14.2\%) in 2011-2012 (P\,{$<$}\,.001 for trend) and increased significantly in every age group, in both sexes, in every racial/ethnic group, by all education levels, and in all poverty income ratio tertiles. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In 2011-2012, the estimated prevalence of diabetes was 12\% to 14\% among US adults, depending on the criteria used, with a higher prevalence among participants who were non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic. Between 1988-1994 and 2011-2012, the prevalence of diabetes increased in the overall population and in all subgroups evaluated.},

This study sought to highlight the problem of diabetes among older adults who participated in a health programme in a rural community. Fasting blood glucose levels and blood pressure of 147 people, aged between 40 years and above, in a rural community in south-east Nigeria were measured. The mean age of participants was 62{$\pm$}10y (1.SD) Thirty-seven (25.2\%) were diabetic, 16 (43\%) of which were undiagnosed. Most (67\%) were aged 50 to 69 years. Twelve (8.2\%) had impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG), of which 83\% were aged 60 to 79 years. Male gender was moderately associated with the risk of diabetes, while family history was strongly associated. Twenty-five (67\%) of the 37 diabetic patients were hypertensive, and only one (5\%) of the 21 with known diabetes had a fasting glucose {$<$}7.0 mmol/L. This report showed a high prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes and impaired fasting glycaemia among these participants in a rural health programme. There is a strong implication for robust studies to validate these findings and an urgent need to improve access to healthcare for rural dwellers.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies of diabetes in Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO) did not assess the prevalence of either unknown diabetes or prediabetes. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed type 2 diabetes and prediabetes as well as variations by region in EMRO, using the relevant publications since 2000. METHODS: We carried out a comprehensive electronic search on electronic databases from January 1, 2000 to March 1, 2018. We selected cross-sectional and cohort studies reporting the prevalence of undiagnosed type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, or both. Two independent reviewers initially screened the eligible articles; then, synthesized the target data from full papers. Random- or fixed-effect models, subgroup analysis on Human Development Index (HDI), and publication year and sensitivity analysis to minimize the plausible effect of outliers were used. RESULTS: Amongst 849 identified citations, 55 articles were entered into meta-analysis, involving 567,025 individuals. The forest plots estimated 5.46\% (confidence intervals [CI]: 4.77-6.14) undiagnosed diabetic and 12.19\% (CI: 10.13-14.24) prediabetics in EMRO. Low HDI countries and high HDI countries had the highest (7.25\%; CI: 4.59-9.92) and the lowest (3.98\%; CI: 3.11-4.85) undiagnosed diabetes prevalence, respectively. Very high HDI countries and low HDI countries had the highest (13.50\%; CI: 8.43-18.57) and the lowest (7.45\%; 1.20-13.71) prediabetes prevalence, respectively. In addition, meta-regression analysis showed a statistically significant association between publication year and prevalence of prediabetes (Reg Coef~=~0.059, P~=~0.014). But such finding was not observed for undiagnosed diabetes and publication year (Reg Coef~=~0.034, P~=~0.124), prediabetes and HDI (Reg Coef~=~0.128, P~=~0.31) and undiagnosed diabetes and HDI (Reg Coef~=~- 0.04, P~=~0.96). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes was high and increasing. The notion of universal health coverage is a priority; that is the integration of the primary, secondary and tertiary health levels, as well as employing the available action plans. Therefore, future studies, using identical screening tool and diagnostic criteria, are warranted to make an accurate picture of diabetes in EMRO.},

  abstract = {\textbf{Background:} Short sleep duration of less than 5.5h a day has been associated with cardiometabolic risk factors. Epidemiological evidence suggests a rising trend in the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in Nigeria. \textbf{Objective:} The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between traditional cardiometabolic risk factors, prediabetes, and short sleep duration in a group of rural Nigerian women. \textbf{Subjects and Methods:} Five hundred and thirty-eight women living in Ihuokpara, a rural community in Southeast Nigeria, participated in the study. A structured questionnaire was administered to the participants to obtain demographic information and self-reported nighttime sleep duration. Anthropometric measurements and blood pressure were recorded. Participants underwent a 75\hspace{0.6em}g Oral Glucose Tolerance Test using standard protocols. Prediabetes was defined using the World Health Organization criteria (fasting plasma glucose 110\textendash 125\hspace{0.6em}mg/dL or 2h post-glucose 140\textendash 199\hspace{0.6em}mg/dL) and hypertension was defined using the Joint National Committee (JNC-7) criteria. \textbf{Results:} The mean age of the subjects was 49.9 {$\pm$} 16.2 years and 280 (52\%) had no formal education. Hypertension was present in 238 (44.2\%), prediabetes was present in 120 (22.3\%), generalized obesity in 32 (5.9\%), and increased waist circumference ({$>$}88cm) in 116 (21.6\%) women. Average sleep duration of less than 5.5h per night was reported in 182 (33.8\%) women. Short sleep duration was significantly associated with prediabetes and hypertension but not obesity or older age in the subjects. \textbf{Conclusion:} More than a third of the women had short sleep duration and this was a significant risk factor for prediabetes and hypertension in them.},

As part of the international research collaboration agenda for Prediabetes and Cardiovascular Complications Study (PACCS), a pilot study was conducted in one of the Ndokwa communities of Nigeria in 2013. Aim: The study was to obtain preliminary indication of prevalence and reference values of MS in the rural communities of a low-mid income country. Materials and Methods: Seventy-four volunteer participants were recruited, after public lectures in high schools and churches in the community. Body mass index (BMI), blood pressure and waist circumference (WC), blood glucoselevel, and lipid profile were measured. Percentage prevalence MS was determined using commonest three criteria (Third Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III) 2001, International Diabetes Federation (IDF) 2005, and World Health Organization (WHO) 1999). Results: When individual indices of MS are considered separately; the males seem healthier than females. However, the prevalence of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was higher in males than in females. Equal 3\% prevalence of MS was seen in both genders using the WHO standard. Other criteria show prevalence of 8\% females and 11\% males (ATP III), 5\% females and 8\% males (IDF 2005 European), and 14\% females and 17\% males (IDF 2005 Ethnic). Conclusion: The prevalence of MS is higher in males than females; and relative to ATP III 2001 criteria, either the IDF 2005 European may underestimate MS, or the ethnic specific could overestimate the prevalence. Hence, it is important to define the criteria to be used.},

  abstract = {Background: Unreported diabetes mellitus and glucose intolerance have substantial clinical importance. Glucose intolerance precedes diabetes mellitus and it is associated with cardiovascular complications. Subjects with prediabetes have near normal glycated haemoglobin and may only be detected when oral glucose tolerance was performed. Early detection may prevent or delay diabetes and its complications. This study determined the prevalence of un-reported diabetes mellitus and glucose intolerance in Owerri Municipality, Imo State of Nigeria.Methodology: 1,012 apparently healthy subjects aged 45 years and above were recruited for the study. Their anthropometric parameters were measured using standard methods and plasma glucose was measured using glucose oxidase method. Diagnosis of diabetes and pre-diabetes was made according to WHO criteria.Results: A total of 157 subjects had pre-diabetes giving a prevalence of15.5\%. Subjects of aged 40 \textendash{} 59 years were mostly affected. IFG alone, IGT alone and a combination of IFG +IGT occurred in 30.6\%, 62.4\% and 7.0\% respectively of the study population. The highest prevalence of IFG was recorded in the 40 \textendash{} 49 years age group while that of IGT occurred in the 50 \textendash{} 59 years range. A combination of IFG and IGT occurred rarely in the study population, 7.0\% and none was detected after the age of 59 years. A greater proportion of males, 18\%, than females, 14.5\%, had pre-diabetes. Unreported diabetes was detected in 8.6\% of the study population, most of them in the 50 \textendash{} 69 years age bracket. It was more prevalent in the female subjects, 11.1\% than in the male subjects 4.4\%. The mean BMI, WHR, FPG and 2hppG of the pre-diabetes subjects were 28.76 {$\pm$}3.5kg/m2, 0.94 {$\pm$}0.14, 5.28 {$\pm$} 0.75 mmol/l and 8.43 {$\pm$} 1.57mmol/l respectively. Among the male pre-diabetes subjects, peak values for BMI and FPG occurred after 70 years of age while in their female counterparts, peak mean values for these parameters occurred much earlier, 40 -59 years range.Conclusions: The report showed high prevalence of glucose intolerance and un-reported diabetes mellitus in the population. The need for regular screening of the population for glucose intolerance was highlighted in order to reduce the incidence of diabetes and its complications.Key words: Un-reported diabetes mellitus, impaired fasting glycaemia, impaired glucose tolerance, pre-diabetes.},

  abstract = {Background It has been hypothesised that rural sub-Saharan Africa is at an early stage of epidemiological transition from communicable to non-communicable diseases (NCD). Limited information exists about the prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors and the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the adult Nigerian population, especially in the rural setting. Objectives The aim of this study was to assess and describe the prevalence of several cardiometabolic risk factors in the sub-Saharan adult population of a rural Yoruba community, living in south-western Nigeria. Methods The study was a descriptive, cross-sectional, random-sample survey. Participants were visited at home by trained nurses and community health extension workers (CHEW) who administered a questionnaire, took the relevant history, carried out clinical examinations and measurements and took samples for laboratory tests. They were supervised by primary healthcare physicians serving the community. The variables recorded comprised clinical history, CVD risk factors including blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, blood sugar and serum lipid levels, cigarette use, and dietary habits. The participants included 2 000 healthy adults aged 18 to 64 years who had been living in the area for more than three years. Results The average age was 42.1 {$\pm$} 21.6, with 43.7\% (873) being males and 56.3\% (1127) females; 20.8\% were hypertensive with BP {$\geq$} 140/90 mmHg, 42.3\% of the men and 36.8\% of the women had BP {$\geq$} 130/85 mmHg; 2.5\% had diabetes, 1.9\% had hypertriglycerideaemia, 43.1\% had low HDL-C, 3.9\% had general obesity, 14.7\% had abdominal obesity, 3.2\% were physically inactive, and 1.7\% smoked cigarettes. Overall, 12.9\% of the subjects were found to have at least one CVD risk factor. Using the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III criteria, 2.1\% of men and 2.7\% of women in the study population had at least three of the criteria, the commonest being HDL-C {$<$} 40 mg/dl in men or {$<$} 50 mg/dl in women, followed by BP {$\geq$} 130/85 mmHg, then waist circumference {$>$} 88 cm in women or {$>$} 102 cm in men, followed by blood glucose {$\geq$} 110 mg/dl. Conclusion The results obtained from this study strongly suggest a high prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors in this rural population and that the epidemiological transition is not restricted to the urban population. This serves as a wake-up call for action in the planning of health services for the management of CVD and other chronic NCDs.},

A total of 998 subjects randomly selected from five main ministries and departments in the Government Secretariat participated in the survey. Each subject was asked to fast overnight and ingested 75 g of glucose dissolved in 250 mL of water after answering a questionnaire. Relevant anthropometric measurements such as weight, height, waist and hip diameters, and blood pressure also were taken. After 2 hours, of blood was drawn and plasma glucose concentration measured. Diagnosis of diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance was based on 1985 World Health Organization (WHO) cut-off values. Blood glucose results were available in 875 subjects. Seven subjects were found to be diabetic for a prevalence of 0.8\%, with the majority (5 subjects) being newly diagnosed. Nineteen were found to have impaired glucose tolerance for a prevalence of 2.2\%. There were no sex differences between the two groups. All of the newly diagnosed diabetics were asymptomatic. Multivariate analysis revealed that subjects with a family history of diabetes, higher body mass index, and higher systolic blood pressure had higher blood glucose levels. The prevalence of diabetes in this survey is lower than rates reported in recent surveys in Nigeria that used less stringent criteria and different methodologies. The rate is comparable to that of a Tanzanian study that used WHO criteria. However, the rate of impaired glucose tolerance in this study, first to be reported in Nigeria, is lower than that obtained in the Bantu population.},

The study aimed at estimating the prevalence and pattern of major cardiovascular risk factors in both men and women older than 18 years. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of cardiovascular risk factors among semi-urban dwellers in Ekiti State, south-western, Nigeria. 750 participants were drawn from 10 communities. The instrument used was the standard WHO STEPS (II) questionnaire, while blood samples were obtained for analysis. RESULTS: There were 750 participants with 529 (70.53\%) females. The mean age of participants was 61.7{$\pm$}18.50 years and participants' {$\geqslant$}65 years comprised 38.3\%. There were 0.8\%, 24.9\% and 12.4\%, who at the time of this study smoked cigarettes, consumed alcohol, and ate a high salt diet, respectively. The prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, generalized and abdominal obesity was 47.2\%, 6.8\%, 8.5\% and 32.0\%, respectively, with only 48.9\% receiving hypertension treatment. Elevated total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and low HDL was seen in 4.4\%, 16.7\% and 56.3\% respectively. CONCLUSION: High prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors call for an urgent need for more public health attention and reinforcement of primary preventive strategies to curb its menace.},

Pre-diabetes is reversible, therefore, measures should be taken to halt or slow down its progression to frank diabetes. AIM: The study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes amongst staff of ABUTH, Zaria and identify some cardiovascular risks associated with them. METHODS: A cross-sectional analytical study carried out on 377 healthcare workers who presented at the Medical out-patient department of ABUTH, Zaria in response to an invitation for the 2017 World Diabetes Day free medical screening. HbA1c was assessed via Immunofluorescence method. The difference in HbA1c amongst healthcare workers was determined by One-way Analysis of Variance with Post-hoc Bonferroni test. Cardiovascular risk associations were assessed via Multiple Binary Logistic Regression. RESULTS: Pre-diabetes and diabetes prevalence were 19.4\% and 6.5\% respectively. There were 28.6\% undiagnosed diabetic healthcare workers. There was no significant (p=0.35) difference in HbA1c between different categories of healthcare workers, however, random blood glucose was significantly (p=0.042) higher in other healthcare workers than doctors. There was a significant (p{$<$}0.01) association between systolic hypertension and risk of developing pre-diabetes and diabetes (OR, 4.11, CI 0.98-17.30). CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes amongst healthcare workers in Zaria. The odds of hypertensive healthcare workers developing pre-diabetes and diabetes is high. Efforts should be geared at intensifying health education, increased work physical activity and proper diet.},

A total of 277 apparently healthy subjects (73males and 204 females) who were willing to participate were recruited. Anthropometric indices and blood pressure were measured using standard methods while the demographic data and dietary pattern of subjects were obtained using a well-structured questionnaire. 5mls of blood was collected from eligible subjects (20 prediabetes and 20 non prediabetes ) and dispensed in fluoride oxalate and plain containers for glucose, creatinine (Cr), Urea(Ur), Na+, K+, Cl-, and HCO3- estimation respectively using standard methods. The result showed a prevalence of 7.2\% prediabetes in the population. BMI was significantly higher in prediabetes than the control groups (39.4{$\pm$}5.8 vs 29{$\pm$}4.4kg/m2; P{$>$}0.05). Again, significant increases in the prediabetic values of FBG (117.54{$\pm$}16.84 vs 83{$\pm$}16.84mg/dl; P{$>$}0.05) than the control group were observed. The SBP (128{$\pm$} 11.26 vs 120{$\pm$}2.2mmHg; P{$>$}0.05) and DBP (92{$\pm$}4.43 vs 60{$\pm$}5.3mmHg; P{$>$}0.05) was also higher in prediabetic groups. Interestingly, result showed no significant difference between the renal parameters in prediabetes and non prediabetes (p{$>$}0.05). The study therefore, suggests that the major determinant for predabetes in the study population may be hypertension and obesity whereas kidney function was not impaired.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The Fulani are a largely nomadic people known for covering great distances on foot with a resulting lean physique and presumably low incidence of diabetes mellitus. However, with modernization some Fulani have adopted sedentary lifestyles, western diet and white collar occupations which are risk factors for diabetes mellitus and related non-communicable diseases. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is rising worldwide with urbanization and sedentary lifestyle being major risk factors. There is paucity of data on the glucose tolerance status among the Fulani ethnic group. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and lifestyle, anthropometric and biochemical risk factors for glucose intolerance among the Fulani ethnic group in Northern Nigeria. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS \textendash{} Seven hundred and eighty -two subjects were recruited for the study using a multi-stage sampling method. Three hundred and ninety- three subjects were rural dwellers while three hundred and eighty-nine were urban dwellers. Using a modification of the WHO STEPS, information on socioeconomic and demographic data and risk factors for glucose intolerance (exercise, diet, alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking) was obtained by means of a questionnaire administered by a trained assistant. Each subject was briefly examined and blood pressure and ~anthropometric measurements including height, weight, waist and hip circumference made. Casual or fasting plasma glucose was obtained in all subjects while plasma lipids and insulin and oral glucose tolerance were assessed in a selected group of 100 subjects. Glucose intolerance was defined using WHO criteria while insulin resistance was estimated using HOMA-IR. Raw data were entered into a spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel 2003) and exported to Epi-Info version 3.3.2 where necessary. Statistical analysis was performed using Epi-Info version 3.3.2. Significance of differences between group means was assessed using Student's t \textendash{} test while {$\chi$}2 statistic was employed to determine significance of results of comparison of proportions between groups. Average values are presented as mean (SD). Level of statistical significance is set p{$<$}0.05. RESULTS \textendash{} Of the 800 subjects recruited into the study, 782 subjects [376(48.1\%) females and 406(51.9\%) males] completed the study, giving a response rate of 97.7\%. There was no significant difference between the proportions of males and females (p{$>$}0.05). The mean (SD) age of the rural subjects was 38.5(13.6) years and that of the urban was 39.4(14.2) years (p= 0.45). The mean (SD) weight of the urban subjects [65.9(12.9)] kg was significantly higher than the rural subjects [58.5(9.7)] kg (p{$<$}0.05). The mean (SD) BMI of the urban subjects [24(4.2)] kg/m2 was significantly~higher than the rural subjects [21.9(3.1)] kg/m2 (p{$<$}0.05). The mean (SD) waist circumference of the urban subjects [84.3(10.6)] cm was significantly higher than the mean waist circumference of the rural subjects [78.6(8.7)] cm (p{$<$}0.05). The risk factors for diabetes mellitus were higher in the urban than the rural subjects. The major risk factors for diabetes mellitus and glucose intolerance from this study were increased age and obesity. The mean (SD) FPG of the urban subjects [5.37(1.8)] mmol/l was significantly higher than the rural subjects [5.02(0.59)] mmol/l (p{$<$}0.05). The urban subjects had higher plasma post glucose load [6.5(1.6)] mmol/l than the rural subjects [6.3(1)] mmol/l but not statistically significant (p= 0.45). The mean fasting plasma insulin levels were significantly higher in the urban [16.1(15.9)] \textmu U/ml than the rural subjects [13.2(13.6)] \textmu U/ml (p=0.041). The mean HOMA-IR level was significantly higher in the urban [4.22(5)] than the rural subjects [2.32(2.5)] (p=0.024). The prevalence of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Sokoto was 2.7\% with urban and rural populations having prevalence rates of 4.6\% and 0.8\% respectively. The prevalence of impaired fasting glycaemia was 14.9\% significantly higher in urban (16.9\%) than in rural (12.7\%) locations (p = 0.002). The prevalence of insulin resistance was 23\% with urban and rural populations having prevalence rates of 30\% and 16\% respectively. ~CONCLUSIONS - The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in the Fulani of North western Nigeria was higher than the overall previous national prevalence indicating increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus in Nigeria. The prevalence of glucose intolerance and its risk factors were higher in the urban Fulani than the rural Fulani. The prevalence of insulin resistance was higher in the urban community than the rural community. There is need for prospective studies in the glucose intolerant subjects and insulin resistant subjects in order to monitor for the development of diabetes mellitus. The results underline the need to increase public screening and to emphasize the value of lifestyle modification toward traditional African lifestyle.},

  abstract = {Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a major cause of morbidity and a leading contributor to mortality worldwide. Over the next 2 decades, it is projected that there will be a rise in CVD mortality rates in the developing countries, linked to demographic changes and progressive urbanization. Nigeria has witnessed tremendous socio-economic changes and rural-urban migration which have led to the emergence of noncommunicable diseases. We set out to determine the prevalence of modifiable CVD risk factors among apparently healthy adult Nigerians. This is a descriptive cross-sectional study carried out at Katsina, northwestern Nigeria from March to May 2006. Subjects for the study were recruited consecutively from local residents, hospital staff and relations of in-patients of the Federal Medical Centre, Katsina using convenience sampling. Socio-demographic information, anthropometric measurements and blood pressure were obtained from the subjects in a standardized manner. Venous samples were collected for necessary investigations and analyzed at the hospital central laboratory. Findings: Three hundred subjects (129 males and 171 females) with a mean age of 37.6 {$\pm$} 10.6 (range 18-75) years were studied. Prevalence of the modifiable cardiovascular risk factors screened for were as follows: generalized obesity 21.3\% (males 10.9\%, females 29.2\%, p {$<$} 0.05), truncal obesity 43.7\% (males 12.4\%, females 67.3\%, p {$<$} 0.05), hypertension 25.7\% (males 27.9, females 24\%, p {$>$} 0.05), type 2 diabetes mellitus 5.3\% (males 5.4\%, females 5.3\%, p {$>$} 0.05), hypercholesterolaemia 28.3\% (males 23.3\%, females 32.2\%, p {$<$} 0.05), elevated LDL-cholesterol 25.7\% (males 28\%, females 24\%, p {$>$} 0.05), low HDL-cholesterol 59.3\% (males 51.9\%, females 65\%, p {$<$} 0.05), hypertriglyceridaemia 15\% (males 16.3\%, females 14\%, p {$>$} 0.05) and metabolic syndrome 22\% (males 10.9\%, females 30.4\%, p {$<$} 0.05). Conclusions: We found high prevalence of CVD risk factors among apparently healthy adult Nigerians. In order to reduce this high prevalence and prevent subsequent cardiovascular events, encouragement of a healthy lifestyle is suggested.},

  abstract = {, Diabetes is an important chronic disease both in terms of prevalence and associated morbidity and early mortality. Mortality rates in diabetics are two - to three-fold higher than those without diabetes, it is a large, growing and costly public health problem and over 50\% of persons with prediabetes are detected only by Oral Glucose Tolerance (OGT) findings. One hundred and sixty-eight (168) subjects comprising of fifty-six (56) adult males and one hundred and twelve (112) adult females of Nasarawa State Polytechnic Lafia were used to assess the Occurrence of (IGT) by subjecting them to an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). (OGTT) gives us more information on the likelihood of being diabetic by showing a pre diabetic concentration of glucose in the blood. From the findings in this research, All the 56 males and the 112 females have their fasting Blood Glucose Level (BGL) within normal range, but for 2-hour (BGL), 7 Males (12.5\%) and 12 females (11.0\%) showed an (IGT) of (7.8mmol/L \textendash{} 9.6mmol/L) and (8.0mmol/L \textendash{} 15.9mmol/L) respectively. Looking at the result based on {$\pm$} Standard Deviation (SD), Females have elevated 2-hour Glucose concentration (6.19mmol/l {$\pm$} 0.34mmol/l which indicate IGT) than Males (5.15mmol/l {$\pm$} 0.22mmol/l) significant (P{$<$}0.05). It will be very appropriate for people particularly adults to check their OGT level from time to time for early detection of IGT the silent metabolic disorder that precedes progression to active diabetes.},

  abstract = {Introduction There has been no nationwide health (diabetes) survey in Nigeria since 1992, when a diabetes mellitus (DM) prevalence of 2.2\% was reported. We aimed to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for DM in Nigeria by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods We searched Medline, EMBASE, PubMed, PapersFirst, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, Bioline, African Journals Online, Institute of Scientific Information, and Google Scholar from the year 1990 to 2017. Using MeSH headings, the terms ``diabetes mellitus,'' ``risk factors,'' ``prevalence,'' and ``Nigeria'' as well as variations thereof were searched for. The last search was performed on 26 November 2017. We only included studies that utilized the random plasma glucose test, the fasting plasma glucose test, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or HbA1c~to diagnose DM. A total of 23 studies (n\,=\,14,650 persons) were evaluated. A random effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of DM. We estimated the overall pooled prevalence of DM and subgroup-specific DM prevalences while accounting for inter-study and intra-study variability/heterogeneity. Results The overall pooled prevalence of DM was 5.77\% (95\% CI 4.3\textendash 7.1). The pooled prevalences of DM in the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria were 3.0\% (95\% CI 1.7\textendash 4.3) in the north-west, 5.9\% (95\% CI 2.4\textendash 9.4) in the north-east, 3.8\% (95\% CI 2.9\textendash 4.7) in the north-central zone, 5.5\% (95\% CI 4.0\textendash 7.1) in the south-west, 4.6\% (95\% CI 3.4\textendash 5.9) in the south-east, and 9.8\% (95\% CI 7.2\textendash 12.4) in the south-south zone. Risk factors for the pooled prevalence of DM were a family history of DM (4.6\%; 95\% CI 3.5\textendash 5.6); urban dwelling (6.0\%; 95\% CI 4.3\textendash 7.8); unhealthy dietary habits (8.0\%; 95\% CI 5.4\textendash 10.5); cigarette smoking (4.4\%; 95\% CI 1.3\textendash 10.2); older age (6.6\%; 95\% CI 4.5\textendash 8.7); physical inactivity (4.8\%; 95\% CI 3.2\textendash 6.4); and obesity (5.3\%; 95\% CI 3.8\textendash 6.9). Conclusion There has been an increase in the prevalence of DM in Nigeria. All regions of the country have been affected, with the highest prevalence seen in the south-south geopolitical zone. Urban dwelling, physical inactivity, advanced age, and unhealthy diet are important risk factors for DM among Nigerians. A national diabetes care and prevention policy is highly recommended.},

  abstract = {Background: Early identification of high-risk individuals is essential in the prevention and control of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). This study assessed the risk of T2DM and validated the American Diabetes Association (ADA) risk tool among urban Nigerian women. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 159 consenting women aged {$\geq$}18 years, consecutively recruited at a medical outreach in Sapele, Delta State, Nigeria. The risk of T2DM was assessed with a modified ADA risk tool. Respondents' weight, height, blood pressure and blood glucose levels were measured. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 23.0. Results: The participants had a mean age of: 41.5({$\pm$}13.2) years, body mass index: 27.3({$\pm$}5.38) kg/m2, SBP: 128({$\pm$}19.4) mmHg and DBP: 81({$\pm$}10.8) mmHg. Five (3.1\%) reported a history of gestational diabetes, 21 (13.2\%) had a first degree relative with T2DM, 26 (16.4\%) were physically inactive, and 37 (23.3\%) reported a history of hypertension/use of anti-hypertensives. Forty-eight (30.2\%) had a high-risk for prediabetes and undiagnosed DM. The ADA risk tool was found to be useful with sensitivity (81.8\%), specificity (73.6\%), and ROC area under the curve (0.848, 95\%CI: 0.743\textendash 0.953). Respondents with a high-risk of prediabetes and undiagnosed DM had significantly higher mean BMI (30.7 vs 25.9kg/m2), SBP (141.9 vs 122.5mmHg) and DBP (85.9 vs 79.1 mmHg). Conclusion: The performance of the ADA Risk Tool was useful in this study. One-in-three respondents had a high-risk of prediabetes and~ undiagnosed DM. Overweight/obesity, older age, gestational diabetes and hypertension were significantly associated with a high-risk for~ prediabetes and undiagnosed DM among women.
