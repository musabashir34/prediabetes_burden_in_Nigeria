It had an estimated global incidence of 220 million in 2010. Different studies in SSA and Nigeria in particular have reported increasing prevalence of diabetes in the rural areas. This may be attributed to the rapid 'westernization' of lifestyle in the rural African community.Only few rural survey have been conducted in the Nigeria oil-rich Niger Delta region necessitating this study with the aim of determining the prevalence of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose (IFG). This was a cross-sectional survey involving 500 subjects aged 15 years and above in a typical rural community of Rivers State, Niger Delta region of Nigeria. A questionnaire administered by face-to-face interview was used to assess socio-demographic characteristics of the subjects. Medical history such as prior knowledge of blood sugar status and family history of diabetes were all elicited by the questionnaire. Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were taken in a standardized manner and body mass indices (BMI) calculated as weight in kilogram divided by the square of height in meters. Venous blood glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method. Diabetes mellitus was defined using fasting plasma glucose (FPG) â‰¥ 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) and individuals who were previously known to have diabetes based on history of treatment were also classified to have diabetes. Lipid profile and uric acid of patients were also checked. There were 156 males and 344 females with male to female ratio of 1:2.3.The females were relatively of younger age than the males (40.62 Â± 16.6 years versus 42.84 Â± 17.8).The overall mean age was 41.32 Â± 17. The mean fasting plasma glucose among those with diabetes was 11.14?4. 00mmol/L while the mean for the subjects with impaired fasting glucose was 6.31 Â± 0.25 mmol/l. The prevalence of diabetes was 2.2% with no significant gender difference (2.6% in males versus 2.0% in females; Ï‡2 = 0.35; p = 0.84). The prevalence of Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) was 2.4%with no significant gender difference (Female 2.6% versus males 1.9%; p = 0.88). The mean fasting glucose increased significantly with blood pressure (p = 0.05), waist circumference (p < 0.001), uric acid level (0.02), triglyceride level (< 0.001) and age (p = 0.02).The correlation analyses showed that age, systolic blood pressure, waist-hip-ratio and triglycerides are positively correlated with diabetes and impaired fasting glucose in this study. There is a low prevalence of diabetes and IFG in this rural community which may be associated to the high level of physical activity found among the study subjects in this community. However, this study confirmed that increasing age, abdominal obesity, systolic blood pressure and triglyceride level have positive relationship with the prevalence of diabetes and IFG. There is hence more need for intensified screening for diabetes, pre-diabetes and associated risk factors in order to curb or at least reduce diabetes prevalence and its attendant complications.",NA,NA,"C A Alikor, P C Emem-Chioma (2015) Epidemiology of Diabetes and Impaired Fasting Glucose in a Rural Community of Nigerian Niger Delta Region. <i>Nigerian Journal of Medicine : Journal of the National Association of Resident Doctors of Nigeria</i>.

Either casual or fasting plasma glucose was obtained in all subjects while oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed in a randomly selected subset of 48 subjects. Glucose intolerance or dysglycaemia was defined using WHO criteria as the presence of diabetes mellitus, impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

In addition, socio-economic status (SES), an important component of the socioeconomic gradient in CVD and its risk factors has not been clearly elucidated. This study sought to assess the prevalence of CVD risk factors and how the difference in prevalence and accessibility to CVD risk screening across income levels and educational backgrounds contributes to disease diagnosis in rural and urban Nigerian adults. A cross sectional study was carried out on a sociocultural ethnic group of persons living in rural and urban settings. All participants were agedâ€‰â‰¥â€‰18 years. The WHO STEPS questionnaire was used to document the demographics, history of previous medical check-up or screening, anthropometric and biochemical measurements of the participants. Average income level and educational status were indicators used to assess the impact of SES. Multivariate analyses were performed to assess any difference between the geographical locations and SES indicators, and prevalence of CVD risk factors and access to CVD risk screening. The 422 participants (273 females and 149 males) [corrected] had mean age (Â± standard deviation) of 38.3â€‰Â±â€‰20.5 and 42.9â€‰Â±â€‰20.7 years, respectively. Only total cholesterol (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001), triglyceride (pâ€‰=â€‰0.005), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) (pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001), body mass index (BMI) (pâ€‰=â€‰0.03) and average income rate (pâ€‰=â€‰0.01) showed significant difference between gender groups. Overall prevalence of prediabetes (4.9%), diabetes (5.4%), hypertension (35.7%), low HDL (17.8%), hypertriglyceridemia (23.2%), hypercholesterolemia (38.1%) and central obesity of 52.2% was recorded. Except between total cholesterol (pâ€‰=â€‰0.042) and HDL (pâ€‰=â€‰0.017), other CVD risk factors did not show a statistical significance across income levels. Participants with 'university and postgraduate education' had higher access to blood pressure and blood glucose screening compared to other educational groups; and this showed a statistical significance. This study has shown that a significant number of modifiable CVD risk factors exist in the rural and urban migrants of an adult Nigerian population. While income level did not affect the CVD risk factor prevalence, it did affect accessibility to CVD risk screening. There is a need for access to diagnosis of modifiable risk factors at all levels of society.",NA,NA,Victor Maduabuchi Oguoma et al.

A total of 998 subjects randomly selected from five main ministries and departments in the Government Secretariat participated in the survey. Each subject was asked to fast overnight and ingested 75 g of glucose dissolved in 250 mL of water after answering a questionnaire. Relevant anthropometric measurements such as weight, height, waist and hip diameters, and blood pressure also were taken. After 2 hours, of blood was drawn and plasma glucose concentration measured. Diagnosis of diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance was based on 1985 World Health Organization (WHO) cut-off values. Blood glucose results were available in 875 subjects. Seven subjects were found to be diabetic for a prevalence of 0.8%, with the majority (5 subjects) being newly diagnosed. Nineteen were found to have impaired glucose tolerance for a prevalence of 2.2%. There were no sex differences between the two groups. All of the newly diagnosed diabetics were asymptomatic. Multivariate analysis revealed that subjects with a family history of diabetes, higher body mass index, and higher systolic blood pressure had higher blood glucose levels. The prevalence of diabetes in this survey is lower than rates reported in recent surveys in Nigeria that used less stringent criteria and different methodologies. The rate is comparable to that of a Tanzanian study that used WHO criteria. However, the rate of impaired glucose tolerance in this study, first to be reported in Nigeria, is lower than that obtained in the Bantu population.",NA,NA,"S T Olatunbosun, P O Ojo, N S Fineberg, A F Bella (1998) Prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus and Impaired Glucose Tolerance in a Group of Urban Adults in Nigeria. <i>Journal of the National Medical Association</i>.

As part of the international research collaboration agenda for Prediabetes and Cardiovascular Complications Study (PACCS), a pilot study was conducted in one of the Ndokwa communities of Nigeria in 2013. The study was to obtain preliminary indication of prevalence and reference values of MS in the rural communities of a low-mid income country. Seventy-four volunteer participants were recruited, after public lectures in high schools and churches in the community. Body mass index (BMI), blood pressure and waist circumference (WC), blood glucoselevel, and lipid profile were measured. Percentage prevalence MS was determined using commonest three criteria (Third Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III) 2001, International Diabetes Federation (IDF) 2005, and World Health Organization (WHO) 1999). When individual indices of MS are considered separately; the males seem healthier than females. However, the prevalence of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was higher in males than in females. Equal 3% prevalence of MS was seen in both genders using the WHO standard. Other criteria show prevalence of 8% females and 11% males (ATP III), 5% females and 8% males (IDF 2005 European), and 14% females and 17% males (IDF 2005 Ethnic). The prevalence of MS is higher in males than females; and relative to ATP III 2001 criteria, either the IDF 2005 European may underestimate MS, or the ethnic specific could overestimate the prevalence. Hence, it is important to define the criteria to be used.",NA,NA,"E U Nwose, V M Oguoma, P T Bwititi, R S Richards (2015) Metabolic Syndrome and Prediabetes in Ndokwa Community of Nigeria: Preliminary Study. <i>North American Journal of Medical Sciences</i>.

This study therefore characterised CVDs risk factors in subjects with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and diabetes. Data from 4 population-based cross-sectional studies on 2447 apparently healthy individuals from 18 - 89Â years were analysed. Anthropometric, blood pressure and biochemical parameters were collected and classified. Individuals with IFG (prediabetes) and diabetes were merged each for positive cases of dyslipidaemia, high blood pressure (HBP) or obesity. Optimal Discriminant and Hierarchical Optimal Classification Tree Analysis (HO-CTA) were employed. Overall prevalence of IFG and diabetes were 5.8% (CI: 4.9 - 6.7%) and 3.1% (CI: 2.4 - 3.8%), respectively. IFG co-morbidity with dyslipidaemia (5.0%; CI: 4.1 - 5.8%) was the highest followed by overweight/obese (3.1%; CI: 2.5 - 3.8%) and HBP (1.8%; CI: 1.3 - 2.4%). The predicted age of IFG or diabetes and their co-morbidity with other CVD risk factors were between 40 - 45Â years. Elevated blood level of total cholesterol was the most predictive co-morbid risk factor among IFG and diabetes subjects. Hypertriglyceridaemia was an important risk factor among IFG-normocholesterolaemic-overweight/obese individuals. The higher prevalence of co-morbidity of CVD risk factors with IFG than in diabetes plus the similar age of co-morbidity between IFG and diabetes highlights the need for risk assessment models for prediabetes and education of individuals at risk about factors that mitigate development of diabetes and CVDs.",NA,NA,Victor M Oguoma et al.

The staples of the poor consisted of one or two bulky carbohydrate meals (derivatives of different species of cocoyam, cassava, yam and maize) eaten with vegetable soup in palm oil, melon seeds, snail, occasional meat and fish. The diet of the high income class included also beans, rice and more animal proteins. Alcohol (mainly palm wine) was consumed only occasionally. The subjects were divided into male and female and were age-matched into various age groups. Anthropometric data of each subject was obtained alongside the family history and socio-economic status. The subjects were further divided into low income vis-a-vis high income groups. All the subjects were normal volunteers, ambulatory, asymptomatic and free from chronic or acute illness. The fasting capillary whole blood glucose (FBG) and 2-h blood glucose following a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) of each subject were measured. The body mass index (BMI) and dental caries scoring of each subject were also determined. The FBG levels and 2-h blood glucose following OGTT were significantly elevated in all subjects particularly in the low income groups except in the under 18-year group. The increases were observed in males and females although glucose levels were lower in the female age group. However, diagnosis of impaired glucose tolerance according to WHO criteria was present in both income groups. The BMI increased as the age increased particularly in the low income groups. There was a strong relationship between age, FBG, IGT and dental caries, respectively in the population. It is concluded that there was strong relationship between poverty, asymptomatic hyperglycemia, and impaired glucose tolerance in the area where cyanogen in diet was higher while there was marginal animal protein in the diet of the poor.",NA,NA,"J O Akpan, R L Gingerich (1991) Association of Hyperglycemia with Dietary Cyanogen and Socio-Economic Level. the Study of Rural Communities in South-East Nigeria. <i>Acta Diabetologica Latina</i>.
