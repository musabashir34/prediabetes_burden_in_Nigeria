It had an estimated global incidence of 220 million in 2010. Different studies in SSA and Nigeria in particular have reported increasing prevalence of diabetes in the rural areas. This may be attributed to the rapid 'westernization' of lifestyle in the rural African community.Only few rural survey have been conducted in the Nigeria oil-rich Niger Delta region necessitating this study with the aim of determining the prevalence of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose (IFG). This was a cross-sectional survey involving 500 subjects aged 15 years and above in a typical rural community of Rivers State, Niger Delta region of Nigeria. A questionnaire administered by face-to-face interview was used to assess socio-demographic characteristics of the subjects. Medical history such as prior knowledge of blood sugar status and family history of diabetes were all elicited by the questionnaire. Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were taken in a standardized manner and body mass indices (BMI) calculated as weight in kilogram divided by the square of height in meters. Venous blood glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method. Diabetes mellitus was defined using fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) and individuals who were previously known to have diabetes based on history of treatment were also classified to have diabetes. Lipid profile and uric acid of patients were also checked. There were 156 males and 344 females with male to female ratio of 1:2.3.The females were relatively of younger age than the males (40.62 ± 16.6 years versus 42.84 ± 17.8).The overall mean age was 41.32 ± 17. The mean fasting plasma glucose among those with diabetes was 11.14?4. 00mmol/L while the mean for the subjects with impaired fasting glucose was 6.31 ± 0.25 mmol/l. The prevalence of diabetes was 2.2% with no significant gender difference (2.6% in males versus 2.0% in females; χ2 = 0.35; p = 0.84). The prevalence of Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) was 2.4%with no significant gender difference (Female 2.6% versus males 1.9%; p = 0.88). The mean fasting glucose increased significantly with blood pressure (p = 0.05), waist circumference (p < 0.001), uric acid level (0.02), triglyceride level (< 0.001) and age (p = 0.02).The correlation analyses showed that age, systolic blood pressure, waist-hip-ratio and triglycerides are positively correlated with diabetes and impaired fasting glucose in this study. There is a low prevalence of diabetes and IFG in this rural community which may be associated to the high level of physical activity found among the study subjects in this community. However, this study confirmed that increasing age, abdominal obesity, systolic blood pressure and triglyceride level have positive relationship with the prevalence of diabetes and IFG. There is hence more need for intensified screening for diabetes, pre-diabetes and associated risk factors in order to curb or at least reduce diabetes prevalence and its attendant complications.",NA,NA

Determining a country's GDM prevalence can assist with policy guidelines regarding GDM screening and management, and can highlight areas requiring research. This systematic review assesses GDM prevalence in Africa. Three electronic databases were searched without language restrictions; PubMed, Scopus and the Cochrane Library. Thirty-one search terms were searched. Eligible articles defined GDM, stated what GDM screening approaches were employed and reported GDM prevalence. The reporting quality and risk of bias within each study was assessed. The PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews were followed. The literature search identified 466 unique records. Sixty full text articles were reviewed of which 14 were included in the systematic review. One abstract, for which the full text article could not be obtained, was also included. Information regarding GDM classification, screening methods and prevalence was obtained for six African countries; Ethiopia (n = 1), Morocco (n = 1), Mozambique (n = 1), Nigeria (n = 6), South Africa (n= 4) and Tanzania (n = 1). Prevalence figures ranged from 0% (Tanzania) to 13.9% (Nigeria) with some studies focussing on women with GDM risk factors. Most studies utilised the two hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test and applied the World Health Organization's diagnostic criteria. Six countries, equating to 11% of the African continent, were represented in this systematic review. This indicates how little is known about GDM in Africa and highlights the need for further research. Considering the increasing public health burden of obesity and type 2 diabetes, it is essential that the extent of GDM is understood in Africa to allow for effective intervention programmes.",NA,NA

However, several reports have recognized the potential of fructose in stimulating the elimination of alcohol from the bloodstream, but the effects of such an anti-intoxicating property of fructose on the biochemical features of Syndrome X have remained scarce. Thus, in this study, oral fructose was used to increase the metabolism of alcohol and the associated changes in blood glucose, triacylglycerol, lipoprotein cholesterol and blood pressure were measured and used to classify subjects into the Syndrome X risk category. One gram of fructose/kg body weight was used to 'treat' the intoxication caused by 1.0 g (20%) ethanol/kg body weight administered to forty-five consenting male subjects in apparently good health. The subjects were light alcohol drinkers (<20 g/day) between the ages of 25 and 35 years. Results show that the administered dose of fructose significantly (P<0.05) reduced the duration of alcohol intoxication by 30.7%, and accelerated the elimination (metabolism) of alcohol from bloodstream by 44.7% (P<0.05). However, ethanol+fructose, increased the number of subjects with impaired glucose and triacylglycerol (TAG) levels to 13 (29%) and 43 (96%) from 8 (18%) and 37 (82%) induced by the ethanol dose alone. The TAG number is the summation of those with borderline high and high concentrations.

Seven subjects were found to be diabetic for a prevalence of 0.8%, with the majority (5 subjects) being newly diagnosed. Nineteen were found to have impaired glucose tolerance for a prevalence of 2.2%. There were no sex differences between the two groups. All of the newly diagnosed diabetics were asymptomatic. Multivariate analysis revealed that subjects with a family history of diabetes, higher body mass index, and higher systolic blood pressure had higher blood glucose levels. The prevalence of diabetes in this survey is lower than rates reported in recent surveys in Nigeria that used less stringent criteria and different methodologies. The rate is comparable to that of a Tanzanian study that used WHO criteria. However, the rate of impaired glucose tolerance in this study, first to be reported in Nigeria, is lower than that obtained in the Bantu population.",NA,NA

A new chart for the interconversions between FBG and HbA1c and for predicting their expected values from each other was realized, drawn up and recommended for consideration in the management of diabetic patients along with the WHO recommended chart. There are a lot of normal individuals with HbA1c level that does not conform to (or that are simply higher than) what is regarded as the threshold for the onset of diabetes or prediabetes. Generally, the local (Nigerian) glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level can therefore be said to be distinctly higher for a given blood glucose range and should be taken as such in the management of diabetes in this environment.

Except between total cholesterol (p = 0.042) and HDL (p = 0.017), other CVD risk factors did not show a statistical significance across income levels. Participants with 'university and postgraduate education' had higher access to blood pressure and blood glucose screening compared to other educational groups; and this showed a statistical significance. This study has shown that a significant number of modifiable CVD risk factors exist in the rural and urban migrants of an adult Nigerian population. While income level did not affect the CVD risk factor prevalence, it did affect accessibility to CVD risk screening. There is a need for access to diagnosis of modifiable risk factors at all levels of society.",NA,NA

As part of the international research collaboration agenda for Prediabetes and Cardiovascular Complications Study (PACCS), a pilot study was conducted in one of the Ndokwa communities of Nigeria in 2013. The study was to obtain preliminary indication of prevalence and reference values of MS in the rural communities of a low-mid income country. Seventy-four volunteer participants were recruited, after public lectures in high schools and churches in the community. Body mass index (BMI), blood pressure and waist circumference (WC), blood glucoselevel, and lipid profile were measured. Percentage prevalence MS was determined using commonest three criteria (Third Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III) 2001, International Diabetes Federation (IDF) 2005, and World Health Organization (WHO) 1999). When individual indices of MS are considered separately; the males seem healthier than females. However, the prevalence of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was higher in males than in females. Equal 3% prevalence of MS was seen in both genders using the WHO standard. Other criteria show prevalence of 8% females and 11% males (ATP III), 5% females and 8% males (IDF 2005 European), and 14% females and 17% males (IDF 2005 Ethnic). The prevalence of MS is higher in males than females; and relative to ATP III 2001 criteria, either the IDF 2005 European may underestimate MS, or the ethnic specific could overestimate the prevalence. Hence, it is important to define the criteria to be used.",NA,NA

This flows on to impact public health knowledge of prevalence of diseases, and in turn, the practice of preventive medicine. As part of the international research collaboration agenda for Prediabetes and Cardiovascular Complications Study, a preliminary survey of one of the Ndokwa communities of Nigeria has been carried out. This study was to understand the baseline knowledge, attitudes and practices of a rural community in regards to cardiovascular diseases, and behavior toward risk management. Seventy-four volunteer participants were recruited, after public lectures, through secondary school and churches in the community. The survey was done using questionnaire. The knowledge component comprised questions about educational and personal health opinion. The attitude and practice components comprised questions about exercises and visiting healthcare facilities. Occupational backgrounds were also asked. It is observed that majority of the community dwellers have (1) completed at least secondary education, (2) never attended a health check-up; and (3) do not engage in physical activity in the context of exercise. Twenty of the participants indicated not being in good health, of which only 35% have attended medical check-up for their ailment. Many of those who are yet to seek healthcare service cite affordability as their reason. With specific regards to diabetes and cardiovascular risk, over 71% of the survey participants are yet to do any blood sugar and/or lipid profile tests. This preliminary survey indicates that although the majority of respondents have secondary education and therefore are relatively literate, there is a gap between their knowledge of ill-health versus attitude and practice toward prevention; especially cardiovascular and diabetes diseases.",NA,NA

To determine the frequency of undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes in a group of hypertensives and normotensives. Anthropometry, blood pressure and standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were done in adult participants (hypertensive and normotensive controls) newly presenting to a General Outpatient Clinic of the University College Hospital, Ibadan. Using the OGTT, the frequency of undiagnosed diabetes was 10.4% and 4.3% in hypertensives and normotensives respectively (p = 0.031) but was 5.2% and 2.6% in hypertensives and normotensives respectively using fasting plasma glucose (FPG) alone (p=0.308).Using the OGTT, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) was diagnosed in 32.2% of hypertensives compared to 14.8% of normotensives (p = 0.002) while impaired fasting glucose (IFG) was diagnosed in 5.2% of hypertensive and 2.6% of the normotensives (p = 0.288). After adjusting for hypertension, age, level of education, body mass index and waist circumference, hypertensives and persons with a higher waist circumference had statistically significantly increased odds of having glucose intolerance: hypertension (OR 2.915; 95% CI 1.526-5.556) and waist circumference (OR 1.050; 95% CI 1.010-1.090). Diabetes and prediabetes are commoner in hypertensive persons and such persons require close and frequent monitoring for the development of this disease.

Using a modification of the WHO STEP wise approach to surveillance (STEPS) instrument, information on sociodemographic and anthropometric data was obtained. Either a casual or fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level was obtained in all subjects while oral glucose tolerance test was performed in a randomly selected group of 50 of the study participants. Three hundred and ninety-three subjects participated in the study. The prevalence rates of DM, impaired fasting glycemia (IFG), and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) were 0.8, 6.9, and 8%, respectively. The mean (SD) FPG was higher in males (5.1 ± 0.6 mmol/L) than in females (4.9 ± 0.6 mmol/l), but not statistically significantly (P = 0.20). The major risk factors for DM among the rural Fulani were obesity and increasing age. The prevalence rates of DM and its principal risk factor obesity are low among the rural Nigerian Fulani. However, the prevalence of prediabetes is relatively high, a factor that may predispose to the future development of DM.",NA,NA
