This study aimed to determine the pattern of dysglycemia in Calabar city in South East Nigeria. This was a cross-sectional observational study. 1134 adults in Calabar were recruited. A multistage sampling method randomly selected 4 out of 22 wards, and 50 households from each ward. All adults within each household were recruited and an oral glucose tolerance test was performed. Dysglycemia was defined as any form of glucose intolerance, including: impaired fasting glucose (blood glucose level 110-125â€…mg/dL), impaired glucose tolerance (blood glucose level â‰¥140â€…mg/dL 2â€…h after consuming 75â€…g of glucose), or diabetes mellitus (DM), as defined by fasting glucose level â‰¥126â€…mg/dL, or a blood glucose level â‰¥200â€…mg/dL, 2â€…h after a 75â€…g glucose load.

The prevalence of impaired fasting glucose was 9%, the prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance 20%, and the prevalence of undiagnosed DM 7%. All values were a few percentage points higher for men than women. The prevalence of undiagnosed DM among residents of Calabar is similar to studies elsewhere in Nigeria but much higher than the previous national prevalence survey, with close to a quarter of the adults having dysglycemia and 7% having undiagnosed DM.

In addition, socio-economic status (SES), an important component of the socioeconomic gradient in CVD and its risk factors has not been clearly elucidated. This study sought to assess the prevalence of CVD risk factors and how the difference in prevalence and accessibility to CVD risk screening across income levels and educational backgrounds contributes to disease diagnosis in rural and urban Nigerian adults. A cross sectional study was carried out on a sociocultural ethnic group of persons living in rural and urban settings. All participants were agedâ€‰â‰¥â€‰18 years. The WHO STEPS questionnaire was used to document the demographics, history of previous medical check-up or screening, anthropometric and biochemical measurements of the participants. Average income level and educational status were indicators used to assess the impact of SES. Multivariate analyses were performed to assess any difference between the geographical locations and SES indicators, and prevalence of CVD risk factors and access to CVD risk screening. The 422 participants (273 females and 149 males) [corrected] had mean age (Â± standard deviation) of 38.3â€‰Â±â€‰20.5 and 42.9â€‰Â±â€‰20.7 years, respectively.

Overall prevalence of prediabetes (4.9%), diabetes (5.4%), hypertension (35.7%), low HDL (17.8%), hypertriglyceridemia (23.2%), hypercholesterolemia (38.1%) and central obesity of 52.2% was recorded. Except between total cholesterol (pâ€‰=â€‰0.042) and HDL (pâ€‰=â€‰0.017), other CVD risk factors did not show a statistical significance across income levels. Participants with 'university and postgraduate education' had higher access to blood pressure and blood glucose screening compared to other educational groups; and this showed a statistical significance. This study has shown that a significant number of modifiable CVD risk factors exist in the rural and urban migrants of an adult Nigerian population. While income level did not affect the CVD risk factor prevalence, it did affect accessibility to CVD risk screening.

It had an estimated global incidence of 220 million in 2010. Different studies in SSA and Nigeria in particular have reported increasing prevalence of diabetes in the rural areas. This may be attributed to the rapid 'westernization' of lifestyle in the rural African community.Only few rural survey have been conducted in the Nigeria oil-rich Niger Delta region necessitating this study with the aim of determining the prevalence of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose (IFG). This was a cross-sectional survey involving 500 subjects aged 15 years and above in a typical rural community of Rivers State, Niger Delta region of Nigeria. A questionnaire administered by face-to-face interview was used to assess socio-demographic characteristics of the subjects. Medical history such as prior knowledge of blood sugar status and family history of diabetes were all elicited by the questionnaire. Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were taken in a standardized manner and body mass indices (BMI) calculated as weight in kilogram divided by the square of height in meters. Venous blood glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method. Diabetes mellitus was defined using fasting plasma glucose (FPG) â‰¥ 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) and individuals who were previously known to have diabetes based on history of treatment were also classified to have diabetes. Lipid profile and uric acid of patients were also checked. There were 156 males and 344 females with male to female ratio of 1:2.3.The females were relatively of younger age than the males (40.62 Â± 16.6 years versus 42.84 Â± 17.8).The overall mean age was 41.32 Â± 17. The mean fasting plasma glucose among those with diabetes was 11.14?4. 00mmol/L while the mean for the subjects with impaired fasting glucose was 6.31 Â± 0.25 mmol/l. The prevalence of diabetes was 2.2% with no significant gender difference (2.6% in males versus 2.0% in females; Ï‡2 = 0.35; p = 0.84). The prevalence of Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) was 2.4%with no significant gender difference (Female 2.6% versus males 1.9%; p = 0.88). The mean fasting glucose increased significantly with blood pressure (p = 0.05), waist circumference (p < 0.001), uric acid level (0.02), triglyceride level (< 0.001) and age (p = 0.02).The correlation analyses showed that age, systolic blood pressure, waist-hip-ratio and triglycerides are positively correlated with diabetes and impaired fasting glucose in this study. There is a low prevalence of diabetes and IFG in this rural community which may be associated to the high level of physical activity found among the study subjects in this community. However, this study confirmed that increasing age, abdominal obesity, systolic blood pressure and triglyceride level have positive relationship with the prevalence of diabetes and IFG. There is hence more need for intensified screening for diabetes, pre-diabetes and associated risk factors in order to curb or at least reduce diabetes prevalence and its attendant complications.",NA,NA,"C A Alikor, P C Emem-Chioma (2015) Epidemiology of Diabetes and Impaired Fasting Glucose in a Rural Community of Nigerian Niger Delta Region. <i>Nigerian Journal of Medicine : Journal of the National Association of Resident Doctors of Nigeria</i>.
